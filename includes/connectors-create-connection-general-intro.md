When you add a trigger or action that connects to a service or system, and you don't have an existing or active connection, 
Azure Logic Apps prompts you to provide the connection information, which varies based on the connection type, for example:

* A name to use for the connection
* Your account credentials
* The server or system name
* A connection string
* The authentication type to use
