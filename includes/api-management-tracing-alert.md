> [!IMPORTANT]
> * API Management request tracing using the **Ocp-Apim-Trace** header in a request and using the value of the **Ocp-Apim-Trace-Location** response header is being deprecated.
> * To improve security, tracing can now be enabled at the level of an individual API by obtaining a time-limited token using the API Management REST API, and passing the token in a request to the gateway. For details, see [Enable tracing of an API](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-api-inspector.md#enable-tracing-for-an-api).
> * Take care when enabling tracing, as it can expose sensitive information in the trace data. Ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the trace data.
