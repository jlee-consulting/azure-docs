> [!NOTE]
> When creating a Batch account, you can choose between two *pool allocation* modes: **user subscription** and **Batch service**. For most cases, you should use the default Batch service mode, in which pools are allocated behind the scenes in Azure-managed subscriptions. In the alternative user subscription mode, Batch VMs and other resources are created directly in your subscription when a pool is created. To create a Batch account in user subscription mode, you must also register your subscription with Azure Batch, and associate the account with an Azure Key Vault.
