On the **Label classes** page, specify the set of classes to categorize your data. Your labelers' accuracy and speed are affected by their ability to choose among the classes. For instance, instead of spelling out the full genus and species for plants or animals, use a field code or abbreviate the genus.

Enter one label per row. Use the **+** button to add a new row. If you have more than three or four labels but fewer than 10, you may want to prefix the names with numbers ("1: ", "2: ") so the labelers can use the number keys to speed their work.
