## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, **create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)** before you begin.

Also before you start, **install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), version 16.5 or later** on your development machine. If you have an older version installed already, you can open the *Visual Studio Installer* app on your machine and follow the prompts to update your installation.

The tutorial is driven by a sample project written in C#. **Get the sample project** on your machine by [downloading the Azure Digital Twins samples repository as a ZIP file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-samples/archive/master.zip).
