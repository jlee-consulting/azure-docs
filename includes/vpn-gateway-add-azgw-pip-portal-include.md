3. Specify the values for **Public IP address**. These settings specify the public IP address objects that will be associated to the VPN gateway. A public IP address is assigned to each public IP address object when the VPN gateway is created. The only time the assigned public IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created. IP addresses don't change across resizing, resetting, or other internal maintenance/upgrades of your VPN gateway.
