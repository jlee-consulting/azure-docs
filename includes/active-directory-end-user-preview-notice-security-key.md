> Using a security key as a passwordless authentication method is currently in public preview. If what you're seeing on your screen doesn't match what's being covered in this article, it means that your administrator hasn't turned on this feature yet. Until this feature is turned on, you must choose another authentication method from the [**Security Info** page](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/set-up-your-security-info-from-a-sign-in-prompt-28180870-c256-4ebf-8bd7-5335571bf9a8).
