> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](../articles/azure-functions/functions-versions.md) of the Azure Functions runtime. Support for proxies support is being returned in version 4.x so that you can successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](../articles/azure-functions/functions-proxies.md#api-management-integration). For information about the pending return of proxies in version 4.x, [Monitor the App Service announcements page](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).
