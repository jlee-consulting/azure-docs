|---------------|------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Logic App (Consumption)** | Multi-tenant | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <p><p>Logic apps created by customers *across multiple tenants* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | Consumption (pay-per-use) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Logic App (Consumption)** | Integration service environment <br>(ISE) | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <p><p>Logic apps *in the same environment* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | ISE (fixed) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Logic App (Preview)** | Single-tenant <br>(Preview) | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <p><p>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | Preview ([Functions Premium or App Service hosting plan](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md) with a specific [pricing tier](../articles/app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md)) <p><p>If you run *stateful* workflows, which use [external storage](../articles/azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements), the Azure Logic Apps runtime makes storage transactions that follow [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <p><p>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums. In Visual Studio Code, the changes you make to the default limit values in your logic app project configuration files won't appear in the designer experience. <p><p>For more information, see [Create workflows for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps using Visual Studio Code](../articles/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code.md). |
