   > For scenarios where you have sensitive data, such as credentials, secrets, access tokens, 
   > API keys, and other similar information, make sure to use a tool that protects your data 
   > with the necessary security features, works offline or locally, doesn't sync your data to 
   > the cloud, and doesn't require that you sign in to an online account. This way, you reduce 
   > the risk around exposing sensitive data to the public.
