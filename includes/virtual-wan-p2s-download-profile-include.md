   * For information about Global profiles and hub-based profiles, see [Hub profiles](../articles/virtual-wan/global-hub-profile.md). Failover scenarios are simplified with global profile.

   * If for some reason a hub is unavailable, the built-in traffic management provided by the service ensures connectivity (via a different hub) to Azure resources for point-to-site users. You can always download a hub-specific VPN configuration by navigating to the hub. Under **User VPN (point to site)**, download the virtual hub **User VPN** profile.
1. On the **Download virtual WAN user VPN profile** page, select the **Authentication type** you want, then click **Generate and download profile**.
