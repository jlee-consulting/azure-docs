To work with Azure Digital Twins in this article, you'll need an Azure Digital Twins instance and the required permissions for using it. If you already have an Azure Digital Twins instance set up, you can use that instance and skip to the next section.

Otherwise, follow the instructions in [Set up an instance and authentication](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md). The instructions contain information to help you verify that you've completed each step successfully.

After you set up your instance, make a note of the following values. You'll need these values to connect to the instance later:
* The instance's host name. You can [find the host name in the Azure portal](../articles/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#verify-success-and-collect-important-values).
* The Azure subscription that you used to create the instance. Either its name or its ID will work. You can find the subscription on your instance's **Overview** page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
