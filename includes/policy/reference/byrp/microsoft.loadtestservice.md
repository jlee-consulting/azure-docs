|[Azure load testing resource should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F65c4f833-1f2e-426c-8780-f6d7593bed7a) |Use customer-managed keys(CMK) to manage the encryption at rest for your Azure Load Testing resource.
