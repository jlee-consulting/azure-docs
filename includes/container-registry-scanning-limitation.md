> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some functionality may be unavailable or require more configuration in a container registry that restricts access to private endpoints, selected subnets, or IP addresses. 
> * When accessing the registry from outside the allowed network, you can't list repositories or tags using the Azure portal or other tools.
> * Access by certain [trusted services](../articles/container-registry/allow-access-trusted-services.md) including Azure Security Center requires enabling a setting to allow trusted services to access the registry.
> * Instances of certain Azure services including Azure DevOps Services, Web Apps, and Azure Container Instances are currently unable to access the container registry.
