# Migrate App Service to availability zone support

This guide describes how to migrate the public multi-tenant App Service from non-availability zone support to availability support. We'll take you through the different options for migration.

Azure App Service can be deployed into [Availability Zones (AZ)](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads. This architecture is also known as zone redundancy.

An App Service lives in an App Service plan (ASP), and the App Service plan exists in a single scale unit. App Services are zonal services, which means that App Services can be deployed using one of the following methods:

- For App Services that aren't configured to be zone redundant, the VM instances are placed in a single zone that is selected by the platform in the selected region.
- For App Services that are configured to be zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the VM instances in the App Service plan across all three zones in the selected region. If a VM instance capacity larger than three is specified and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances will be spread evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond 3*N will get spread across the remaining one or two zones.

## Prerequisites

Availability zone support is a property of the App Service plan. The following are the current requirements/limitations for enabling availability zones:

- Both Windows and Linux are supported.
- Requires either **Premium v2** or **Premium v3** App Service plans.
- Minimum instance count of three is enforced.
  - The platform will enforce this minimum count behind the scenes if you specify an instance count fewer than three.
- Can be enabled in any of the following regions:
  - West US 2
  - West US 3
  - Central US
  - East US
  - East US 2
  - Canada Central
  - Brazil South
  - North Europe
  - West Europe
  - Germany West Central
  - France Central
  - UK South
  - Japan East
  - Southeast Asia
  - Australia East
- Availability zones can only be specified when creating a **new** App Service plan. A pre-existing App Service plan can't be converted to use availability zones.
- Availability zones are only supported in the newer portion of the App Service footprint.
  - Currently, if you're running on Pv3, then it's possible that you're already on a footprint that supports availability zones. In this scenario, you can create a new App Service plan and specify zone redundancy.
  - If you aren't using Pv3 or a scale unit that supports availability zones, are in an unsupported region, or are unsure, see the [migration guidance](#migration-guidance-redeployment).

## Downtime requirements

Downtime will be dependent on how you decide to carry out the migration. Since you can't convert pre-existing App Service plans to use availability zones, migration will consist of a side-by-side deployment where you'll create new App Service plans. Downtime will depend on how you choose to redirect traffic from your old to your new availability zone enabled App Service. For example, if you're using an [Application Gateway](../app-service/networking/app-gateway-with-service-endpoints.md), a [custom domain](../app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md), or [Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-overview.md), downtime will be dependent on the time it takes to update those respective services with your new app's information. Alternatively, you can route traffic to multiple apps at the same time using a service such as [Azure Traffic Manager](../app-service/web-sites-traffic-manager.md) and only fully cutover to your new availability zone enabled apps when everything is deployed and fully tested.

## Migration guidance: Redeployment

### When to use redeployment

If you want your App Service to use availability zones, redeploy your apps into newly created availability zone enabled App Service plans.

### Important considerations when using availability zones

Traffic is routed to all of your available App Service instances. In the case when a zone goes down, the App Service platform will detect lost instances and automatically attempt to find new replacement instances and spread traffic as needed. If you have [autoscale](../app-service/manage-scale-up.md) configured, and if it decides more instances are needed, autoscale will also issue a request to App Service to add more instances. Note that [autoscale behavior is independent of App Service platform behavior](../azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview.md) and that your autoscale instance count specification doesn't need to be a multiple of three. It's also important to note there's no guarantee that requests for additional instances in a zone-down scenario will succeed since back filling lost instances occurs on a best-effort basis. The recommended solution is to create and configure your App Service plans to account for losing a zone as described in the next section.

Applications that are deployed in an App Service plan that has availability zones enabled will continue to run and serve traffic even if other zones in the same region suffer an outage. However it's possible that non-runtime behaviors including App Service plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing may still be impacted from an outage in other Availability Zones. Zone redundancy for App Service plans only ensures continued uptime for deployed applications.

When the App Service platform allocates instances to a zone redundant App Service plan, it uses [best effort zone balancing offered by the underlying Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones.md#zone-balancing). An App Service plan will be "balanced" if each zone has either the same number of VMs, or +/- one VM in all of the other zones used by the App Service plan.

### How to redeploy

The following steps describe how to enable availability zones.

1. To redeploy and ensure you'll be able to use availability zones, you'll need to be on the App Service footprint that supports availability zones. If you're already using the Pv3 SKU and are in one of the [supported regions](#prerequisites), you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, you should create a new resource group in one of the supported regions to ensure the App Service control plane can find a scale unit in the selected region that supports availability zones.
1. Create a new App Service plan in one of the supported regions using the **new** resource group.
1. Ensure the zoneRedundant property (described below) is set to true when creating the new App Service plan.
1. Create your apps in the new App Service plan using your desired deployment method.

You can create an App Service with availability zones using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), or an [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md).

To enable availability zones using the Azure CLI, include the `--zone-redundant` parameter when you create your App Service plan. You can also include the `--number-of-workers` parameter to specify capacity. If you don't specify a capacity, the platform defaults to three. Capacity should be set based on the workload requirement, but no less than three. A good rule of thumb to choose capacity is to ensure sufficient instances for the application such that losing one zone of instances leaves sufficient capacity to handle expected load.

```azurecli
az appservice plan create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyPlan --zone-redundant --number-of-workers 6
```

> [!TIP]
> To decide instance capacity, you can use the following calculation:
>
> Since the platform spreads VMs across three zones and you need to account for at least the failure of one zone, multiply peak workload instance count by a factor of zones/(zones-1), or 3/2. For example, if your typical peak workload requires four instances, you should provision six instances: (2/3 * 6 instances) = 4 instances.

To create an App Service with availability zones using the Azure portal, enable the zone redundancy option during the "Create Web App" or "Create App Service Plan" experiences.

The capacity/number of workers/instance count can be changed once the App Service Plan is created by navigating to the **Scale out (App Service plan)** settings.

:::image type="content" source="../app-service/media/how-to-zone-redundancy/capacity-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a capacity update using the portal.":::

The only changes needed in an Azure Resource Manager template to specify an App Service with availability zones are the ***zoneRedundant*** property (required) and optionally the App Service plan instance count (***capacity***) on the [Microsoft.Web/serverfarms](/azure/templates/microsoft.web/serverfarms?tabs=json) resource. The ***zoneRedundant*** property should be set to ***true*** and ***capacity*** should be set based on the same conditions described previously.

The Azure Resource Manager template snippet below shows the new ***zoneRedundant*** property and ***capacity*** specification.

```json
"resources": [
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
    "apiVersion": "2018-02-01",
    "name": "your-appserviceplan-name-here",
    "location": "West US 3",
    "sku": {
        "name": "P1v3",
        "tier": "PremiumV3",
        "size": "P1v3",
        "family": "Pv3",
        "capacity": 3
    },
    "kind": "app",
    "properties": {
        "zoneRedundant": true
    }
  }
]
```

## Pricing

There's no additional cost associated with enabling availability zones. Pricing for a zone redundant App Service is the same as a single zone App Service. You'll be charged based on your App Service plan SKU, the capacity you specify, and any instances you scale to based on your autoscale criteria. If you enable availability zones but specify a capacity less than three, the platform will enforce a minimum instance count of three and charge you for those three instances.
