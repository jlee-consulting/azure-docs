# Receipt data extraction

[!INCLUDE [applies to v3.0 and v2.1](includes/applies-to-v3-0-and-v2-1.md)]

## What is receipt digitization

Receipt digitization is the process of converting scanned receipts into digital form for downstream processing. OCR powered receipt data extraction helps to automate the conversion and save time and effort. The output from the receipt data extraction is used for accounts payable and receivables automation, sales data analytics, and other business scenarios.

## Form Recognizer receipt model

The Form Recognizer receipt model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract key information from sales receipts. Receipts can be of various formats and quality including printed and handwritten receipts. The API extracts key information such as merchant name, merchant phone number, transaction date, tax, and transaction total and returns structured JSON data.

***Sample receipt processed with [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=receipt)***:

### Try receipt data extraction

See how data, including time and date of transactions, merchant information, and amount totals, is extracted from receipts using the Form Recognizer Studio. You'll need the following resources:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.
