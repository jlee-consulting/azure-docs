# Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

This article demonstrates how to:

* Run your Java, Java EE, Jakarta EE, or MicroProfile application on the Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty runtime.
* Build the application Docker image using Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty container images.
* Deploy the containerized application to an AKS cluster using the Open Liberty Operator.

The Open Liberty Operator simplifies the deployment and management of applications running on Kubernetes clusters. With the Open Liberty Operator, you can also perform more advanced operations, such as gathering traces and dumps.

For more information on Open Liberty, see [the Open Liberty project page](https://openliberty.io/). For more information on IBM WebSphere Liberty, see [the WebSphere Liberty product page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty).

This article uses the Azure Marketplace offer for Open/WebSphere Liberty to accelerate your journey to AKS. The offer automatically provisions a number of Azure resources including an Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance, an AKS cluster, an Azure App Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) instance, the Liberty Operator, and optionally a container image including Liberty and your application. To see the offer, visit the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/liberty-aks). If you prefer manual step-by-step guidance for running Liberty on AKS that doesn't utilize the automation enabled by the offer, see [Manually deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/developer/java/ee/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app-manual).

* This article requires at least version 2.31.0 of Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
* If running the commands in this guide locally (instead of Azure Cloud Shell):
  * Prepare a local machine with Unix-like operating system installed (for example, Ubuntu, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  * Install a Java SE implementation (for example, [Eclipse Open J9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/)).
  * Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
  * Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your OS.
* Make sure you have been assigned either the `Owner` role or the `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles in the subscription. You can verify it by following steps in [List role assignments for a user or group](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal.md#list-role-assignments-for-a-user-or-group).

## Create a Liberty on AKS deployment using the portal

The following steps guide you to create a Liberty runtime on AKS. After completing these steps, you'll have an Azure Container Registry and an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for the sample application.

1. Visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). In the search box at the top of the page, type *IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Kubernetes Service*. When the suggestions start appearing, select the one and only match that appears in the **Marketplace** section. If you prefer, you can go directly to the offer with this shortcut link: [https://aka.ms/liberty-aks](https://aka.ms/liberty-aks).
1. Select **Create**.
1. In the **Basics** pane, create a new resource group. Because resource groups must be unique within a subscription, pick a unique name. An easy way to have unique names is to use a combination of your initials, today's date, and some identifier. For example, `ejb0913-java-liberty-project-rg`.
1. Select *East US* as **Region**.
1. Select **Next: Configure cluster**.
1. This section allows you to select an existing AKS cluster and Azure Container Registry (ACR), instead of causing the deployment to create a new one, if desired. This capability enables you to leverage the sidecar pattern, as shown in the [Azure architecture center](/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar). You can also adjust the settings for the size and number of the virtual machines in the AKS node pool. Leave all other values at the defaults and select **Next: Networking**.
1. Next to **Connect to Azure Application Gateway?** select **Yes**. This pane lets you customize the following deployment options.
   1. You can customize the virtual network and subnet into which the deployment will place the resources. Leave these values at their defaults.
   1. You can provide the TLS/SSL certificate presented by the Azure Application Gateway. Leave the values at the default to cause the offer to generate a self-signed certificate. Do not go to production using a self-certificate. For more information about self-signed certificates, see [Create a self-signed public certificate to authenticate your application](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-self-signed-certificate.md).
   1. You can enable cookie based affinity, also known as sticky sessions. We want this enabled for this article, so ensure this option is selected.
      ![Screenshot of the enable cookie-based affinity checkbox.](./media/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app/enable-cookie-based-affinity.png)
1. Select **Review + create** to validate your selected options.
1. When you see the message **Validation Passed**, select **Create**. The deployment may take up to 20 minutes.

## Capture selected information from the deployment

If you navigated away from the **Deployment is in progress** page, the following steps will show you how to get back to that page. If you're still on the page that shows **Your deployment is complete**, you can skip to the third step.

1. In the upper left of any portal page, select the hamburger menu and select **Resource groups**.
1. In the box with the text **Filter for any field**, enter the first few characters of the resource group you created previously. If you followed the recommended convention, enter your initials, then select the appropriate resource group.
1. In the list of resources in the resource group, select the resource with **Type** of **Container registry**.
1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings** select **Access keys**.
1. Save aside the values for **Login server**, **Registry name**, **Username**, and **password**. You may use the copy icon at the right of each field to copy the value of that field to the system clipboard.
1. Navigate again to the resource group into which you deployed the resources.
1. In the **Settings** section, select **Deployments**.
1. Select the bottom-most deployment in the list. The **Deployment name** will match the publisher ID of the offer. It will contain the string **ibm**.
1. In the left pane, select **Outputs**.
1. Using the same copy technique as with the preceding values, save aside the values for the following outputs:

   * **appDeploymentTemplateYamlEncoded**
   * **cmdToConnectToCluster**

   These values will be used later in this article. Note that several other useful commands are listed in the outputs.

## Create an Azure SQL Database

The following steps guide you through creating an Azure SQL Database single database for use with your app.

1. Create a single database in Azure SQL Database by following the steps in [Quickstart: Create an Azure SQL Database single database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart), carefully noting the differences in the box below. Return to this article after creating and configuring the database server.

   > [!NOTE]
   > At the **Basics** step, write down **Resource group**, **Database name**, **_\<server-name>_.database.windows.net**, **Server admin login**, and **Password**. The database **Resource group** will be referred to as `<db-resource-group>` later in this article.
   >
   > At the **Networking** step, set **Connectivity method** to **Public endpoint**, **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** to **Yes**, and **Add current client IP address** to **Yes**.
   >
   > ![Screenshot of configuring SQL database networking.](./media/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app/create-sql-database-networking.png)
   >
   > Also at the **Networking** step, under **Encrypted connections**, set the **Minimum TLS version** to **TLS 1.0**.
   >
   > ![Screenshot of configuring SQL database networking TLS 1.0.](./media/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app/sql-database-minimum-TLS-version.png)

Now that the database and AKS cluster have been created, we can proceed to preparing AKS to host your Open Liberty application.

## Configure and deploy the sample application

Follow the steps in this section to deploy the sample application on the Liberty runtime. These steps use Maven and the `liberty-maven-plugin`.  To learn more about the `liberty-maven-plugin` see [Building a web application with Maven](https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-intro.html).

### Check out the application

Clone the sample code for this guide. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aks).

There are a few samples in the repository. We'll use *java-app/*. Here's the file structure of the application.

```
java-app
├─ src/main/
│  ├─ aks/
│  │  ├─ db-secret.yaml
│  │  ├─ openlibertyapplication.yaml
│  ├─ docker/
│  │  ├─ Dockerfile
│  │  ├─ Dockerfile-local
│  │  ├─ Dockerfile-wlp
│  │  ├─ Dockerfile-wlp-local
│  ├─ liberty/config/
│  │  ├─ server.xml
│  ├─ java/
│  ├─ resources/
│  ├─ webapp/
├─ pom.xml
```

The directories *java*, *resources*, and *webapp* contain the source code of the sample application. The code declares and uses a data source named `jdbc/JavaEECafeDB`.

In the *aks* directory, we placed two deployment files. *db-secret.xml* is used to create [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with DB connection credentials. The file *openlibertyapplication.yaml* is used to deploy the application image.

In the *docker* directory, we placed four Dockerfiles. *Dockerfile-local* is used for local debugging, and *Dockerfile* is used to build the image for an AKS deployment. These two files work with Open Liberty. *Dockerfile-wlp-local* and *Dockerfile-wlp* are also used for local debugging and to build the image for an AKS deployment respectively, but instead work with WebSphere Liberty.

In directory *liberty/config*, the *server.xml* FILE is used to configure the DB connection for the Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty cluster.

### Acquire necessary variables from AKS deployment

After the offer is successfully deployed, an AKS cluster will be generated automatically. The AKS cluster is configured to connect to a generated ACR instance. Before we get started with the application, we need to extract the namespace configured for AKS.

1. Run the following command to print the current deployment file, using the `appDeploymentTemplateYamlEncoded` you saved above. The output contains all the variables we need.

   ```bash
   echo <appDeploymentTemplateYamlEncoded> | base64 -d
   ```

1. Save aside the `metadata.namespace` from this yaml output for later use in this article.

### Build the project

Now that you've gathered the necessary properties, you can build the application. The POM file for the project reads many properties from the environment.

Now that you've gathered the necessary properties, you can build the application. The POM file for the project reads many properties from the environment. The reason for this parameterization is to avoid having to hard-code values such as database server names, passwords, and other identifiers into the example source code. This allows the sample source code to be easier to use in a wider variety of contexts.

```bash
cd <path-to-your-repo>/java-app

# The following variables will be used for deployment file generation
export LOGIN_SERVER=<Azure_Container_Registery_Login_Server_URL>
export REGISTRY_NAME=<Azure_Container_Registery_Name>
export USER_NAME=<Azure_Container_Registery_Username>
export PASSWORD=<Azure_Container_Registery_Password>
export DB_SERVER_NAME=<Server name>.database.windows.net
export DB_PORT_NUMBER=1433
export DB_NAME=<Database name>
export DB_USER=<Server admin login>@<Server name>
export DB_PASSWORD=<Server admin password>
export NAMESPACE=<metadata.namespace>

mvn clean install
```

### Test your project locally

Use the `liberty:devc` command to run and test the project locally before deploying to Azure. For more information on `liberty:devc`, see the [Liberty Plugin documentation](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md#devc-container-mode).
In the sample application, we've prepared *Dockerfile-local* and *Dockerfile-wlp-local* for use with `liberty:devc`.

1. Start your local docker environment if you haven't done so already. The instructions for doing this vary depending on the host operating system.

1. Start the application in `liberty:devc` mode

   ```bash
   cd <path-to-your-repo>/java-app
   
   # If you're running with Open Liberty
   mvn liberty:devc -Ddb.server.name=${DB_SERVER_NAME} -Ddb.port.number=${DB_PORT_NUMBER} -Ddb.name=${DB_NAME} -Ddb.user=${DB_USER} -Ddb.password=${DB_PASSWORD} -Ddockerfile=target/Dockerfile-local
  
   # If you're running with WebSphere Liberty
   mvn liberty:devc -Ddb.server.name=${DB_SERVER_NAME} -Ddb.port.number=${DB_PORT_NUMBER} -Ddb.name=${DB_NAME} -Ddb.user=${DB_USER} -Ddb.password=${DB_PASSWORD} -Ddockerfile=target/Dockerfile-wlp-local
   ```

1. Verify the application works as expected. You should see a message similar to `[INFO] [AUDIT] CWWKZ0003I: The application javaee-cafe updated in 1.930 seconds.` in the command output if successful. Go to `http://localhost:9080/` in your browser and verify the application is accessible and all functions are working.

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop `liberty:devc` mode.

### Build image for AKS deployment

After successfully running the app in the Liberty Docker container, you can run the `docker build` command to build the image.

```bash
cd <path-to-your-repo>/java-app

# Fetch maven artifactId as image name, maven build version as image version
export IMAGE_NAME=$(mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='${project.artifactId}' --non-recursive exec:exec)
export IMAGE_VERSION=$(mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='${project.version}' --non-recursive exec:exec)

cd <path-to-your-repo>/java-app/target

# If you are running with Open Liberty
docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION} --pull --file=Dockerfile .

# If you are running with WebSphere Liberty
docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION} --pull --file=Dockerfile-wlp .
```

### Upload image to ACR

Now, we upload the built image to the ACR created in the offer.

```bash
docker tag ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION} ${LOGIN_SERVER}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION}
docker login -u ${USER_NAME} -p ${PASSWORD} ${LOGIN_SERVER}
docker push ${LOGIN_SERVER}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION}
```

### Deploy and test the application

The following steps deploy and test the application.

1. Connect to the AKS cluster.

   Paste the value of **cmdToConnectToCluster** into a bash shell.

1. Apply the DB secret.

   ```bash
   cd <path-to-your-repo>/java-app/target
   kubectl apply -f db-secret.yaml
   ```

   You'll see the output `secret/db-secret-postgres created`.

1. Apply the deployment file.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f openlibertyapplication.yaml
   ```

1. Wait for the pods to be restarted.

   Wait until all pods are restarted successfully using the following command.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE --watch
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following to indicate that all the pods are running.

   ```bash
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   javaee-cafe-cluster-67cdc95bc-2j2gr   1/1     Running   0          29s
   javaee-cafe-cluster-67cdc95bc-fgtt8   1/1     Running   0          29s
   javaee-cafe-cluster-67cdc95bc-h47qm   1/1     Running   0          29s
   ```

1. Verify the results.

   1. Get endpoint of the deployed service

      ```bash
      kubectl get service -n $NAMESPACE
      ```

   1. Go to `http://EXTERNAL-IP` to test the application.

## Clean up resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources. When the cluster is no longer needed, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to remove the resource group, container service, container registry, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --yes --no-wait
az group delete --name <db-resource-group> --yes --no-wait
```
