# Migrate from Dapr OSS to the Dapr extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

You've installed and configured Dapr OSS on your Kubernetes cluster and want to migrate to the Dapr extension on AKS. Before you can successfully migrate to the Dapr extension, you need to fully remove Dapr OSS from your AKS cluster. In this guide, you will migrate from Dapr OSS by:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Uninstalling Dapr, including CRDs and the `dapr-system` namespace
> - Installing Dapr via the Dapr extension for AKS
> - Applying your components
> - Restarting your applications that use Dapr

> [!NOTE]
> Expect downtime of approximately 10 minutes while migrating to Dapr extension for AKS. Downtime may take longer depending on varying factors. During this downtime, no Dapr functionality should be expected to run.

## Uninstall Dapr 

#### [Dapr CLI](#tab/cli)

1. Run the following command to uninstall Dapr and all CRDs:

```bash
dapr uninstall -k –-all
```

1. Uninstall the Dapr namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace dapr-system
```

> [!NOTE]
> `dapr-system` is the default namespace installed with `dapr init -k`. If you created a custom namespace, replace `dapr-system` with your namespace.

#### [Helm](#tab/helm)

1. Run the following command to uninstall Dapr:

```bash
dapr uninstall -k –-all
```

1. Uninstall CRDs: 

```bash
kubectl delete crd components.dapr.io
kubectl delete crd configurations.dapr.io
kubectl delete crd subscriptions.dapr.io
kubectl delete crd resiliencies.dapr.io
```

1. Uninstall the Dapr namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace dapr-system
```

> [!NOTE]
> `dapr-system` is the default namespace while doing a Helm install. If you created a custom namespace (`helm install dapr dapr/dapr --namespace <my-namespace>`), replace `dapr-system` with your namespace.

## Install Dapr via the AKS extension

Once you've uninstalled Dapr from your system, install the [Dapr extension for AKS and Arc-enabled Kubernetes](./dapr.md#create-the-extension-and-install-dapr-on-your-aks-or-arc-enabled-kubernetes-cluster).

```bash
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \                                               
--cluster-name <dapr-cluster-name> \
--resource-group <dapr-resource-group> \
--name <dapr-ext> \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr
```

## Apply your components

```bash
kubectl apply -f <component.yaml>
```

## Restart your applications that use Dapr

Restarting the deployment will create a new sidecar from the new Dapr installation.

```bash
kubectl rollout restart <deployment-name>
```
