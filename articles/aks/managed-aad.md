# Integrate AKS-managed Azure AD (Preview)

> [!Note]
> Existing AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) clusters with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration are not affected by the new AKS-managed Azure AD experience.

Azure AD integration with AKS-managed Azure AD is designed to simplify the Azure AD integration experience, where users were previously required to create a client app, a server app, and required the Azure AD tenant to grant Directory Read permissions. In the new version, the AKS resource provider manages the client and server apps for you.

## Limitations

* You can't currently upgrade an existing AKS Azure AD-Integrated cluster to the new AKS-managed Azure AD experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as-is" and "as available," and are excluded from the Service Level Agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features are not meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:
>
> - [AKS Support Policies](support-policies.md)
> - [Azure Support FAQ](faq.md)

## Before you begin

* Locate your Azure Account tenant ID by navigating to the Azure portal and select Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID

> [!Important]
> You must use Kubectl with a minimum version of 1.18

You must have the following resources installed:

- The Azure CLI, version 2.5.1 or later
- The aks-preview 0.4.38 extension
- Kubectl with a minimum version of [1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1180)

To install/update the aks-preview  extension or later, use the following Azure CLI commands:

```azurecli
az extension add --name aks-preview
az extension list
```

```azurecli
az extension update --name aks-preview
az extension list
```

To install kubectl, use the following commands:

```azurecli
sudo az aks install-cli
kubectl version --client
```

Use [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for other operating systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> After you register a feature on a subscription, you can't currently unregister that feature. When you enable some preview features, defaults might be used for all AKS clusters created afterward in the subscription. Don't enable preview features on production subscriptions. Instead, use a separate subscription to test preview features and gather feedback.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature register --name AAD-V2 --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

It might take several minutes for the status to show as **Registered**. You can check the registration status by using the [az feature list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/feature?view=azure-cli-latest#az-feature-list) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az feature list -o table --query "[?contains(name, 'Microsoft.ContainerService/AAD-V2')].{Name:name,State:properties.state}"
```

When the status shows as registered, refresh the registration of the `Microsoft.ContainerService` resource provider by using the [az provider register](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/provider?view=azure-cli-latest#az-provider-register) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```
## Azure AD authentication overview

Cluster administrators can configure Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) based on a user's identity or directory group membership. Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID Connect, see the [Open ID connect documentation][open-id-connect].

From inside of the Kubernetes cluster, Webhook Token Authentication is used to verify authentication tokens. Webhook token authentication is configured and managed as part of the AKS cluster.

## Webhook and API server

:::image type="content" source="media/aad-integration/auth-flow.png" alt-text="Webhook and API server authentication flow":::

As shown in the graphic above, the API server calls the AKS webhook server and performs the following steps:

1. The Azure AD client application is used by kubectl to log in users with [OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-device-code).
2. Azure AD provides an access_token, id_token, and a refresh_token.
3. The user makes a request to kubectl with an access_token from kubeconfig.
4. Kubectl sends the access_token to APIServer.
5. The API Server is configured with the Auth WebHook Server to perform validation.
6. The authentication webhook server confirms the JSON Web Token signature is valid by checking the Azure AD public signing key.
7. The server application uses user-provided credentials to query group memberships of the logged-in user from the MS Graph API.
8. A response is sent to the APIServer with user information such as the user principal name (UPN) claim of the access token, and the group membership of the user based on the object ID.
9. The API performs an authorization decision based on the Kubernetes Role/RoleBinding.
10. Once authorized, the API server returns a response to kubectl.
11. Kubectl provides feedback to the user.


## Create an AKS cluster with Azure AD enabled

Create an AKS cluster by using the following CLI commands.

Create an Azure resource group:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an Azure resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location centralus
```

You can use an existing Azure AD group, or create a new one. You need the object ID for your Azure AD group.

```azurecli-interactive
# List existing groups in the directory
az ad group list
```

To reate a new Azure AD group for your cluster administrators, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an Azure AD group
az ad group create --display-name MyDisplay --mail-nickname MyDisplay
```

Create an AKS cluster, and enable administration access for your Azure AD group

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster
az aks create -g MyResourceGroup -n MyManagedCluster --enable-aad [--aad-admin-group-object-ids <id>] [--aad-tenant-id <id>]
```

A successful creation of an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster has the following section in the response body
```
"Azure ADProfile": {
    "adminGroupObjectIds": null,
    "clientAppId": null,
    "managed": true,
    "serverAppId": null,
    "serverAppSecret": null,
    "tenantId": "72f9****-****-****-****-****d011db47"
  }
```

The cluster is created within a few minutes.

## Access an Azure AD enabled cluster

You'll need the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-user-role) built-in role to perform the following steps.

Get the user credentials to access the cluster:
 
```azurecli-interactive
 az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name MyManagedCluster
```
Follow the instructions to sign in.

Use the kubectl get nodes command to view nodes in the cluster:

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get nodes

NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-15306047-0   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
aks-nodepool1-15306047-1   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
aks-nodepool1-15306047-2   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
```
Configure [Role Based Access Control (RGAC)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/azure-ad-rbac?branch=pr-en-us-117564) to configure additional security groups for your clusters.

## Troubleshooting access issues with Azure AD

> [!Important]
> The steps described below are bypassing the normal Azure AD group authentication. Use them only in an emergency.

If you are permanently blocked by not having access to a valid Azure AD group with access to your cluster, you can still obtain the admin credentials to access the cluster directly.

To perform these steps, you'll need to have access to the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-admin-role) built-in role.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name MyManagedCluster --admin
```

## Non-interactive login with kubelogin

There are some non-interactive scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, that are not currently available with kubectl. You can use [kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) to access the cluster in non-interactive scenarios.

## Next steps

* Learn about [Azure AD Role-Based Access Control][azure-ad-rbac].
* Use [kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) to access features for Azure authentication that are not available in kubectl.
