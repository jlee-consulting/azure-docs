# Optimize Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server by using pg_repack

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use pg_repack to remove bloat and improve your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server performance. Bloat is the unnecessary data accumulating in tables and indexes due to frequent updates and deletes. Bloat can cause the database size to grow larger than expected and affect query performance. Using pg_repack, you can reclaim the wasted space and reorganize the data more efficiently.

## What is pg_repack?

pg_repack is a PostgreSQL extension that removes bloat from tables and indexes and reorganizes them more efficiently. pg_repack works by creating a new copy of the target table or index, applying any changes that occurred during the process, and then swapping the old and new versions atomically. pg_repack doesn't require any downtime or exclusive locks on the target table or index except for a brief period at the beginning and end of the operation. You can use pg_repack to optimize any table or index in your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database, except for the default Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database.

### How to use pg_repack?

To use pg_repack, you need to install the extension in your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database and then run the pg_repack command, specifying the table name or index you want to optimize. The extension acquires locks on the table or index to prevent other operations from being performed while the optimization is in progress. It will then remove the bloat and reorganize the data more efficiently.

### How full table repack works

To perform a full table repack, pg_repack will follow these steps:

1.    Create a log table to record changes made to the original table.
2.    Add a trigger to the original table, logging INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs into the log table.
3.    Create a new table containing all the rows in the old table.
4.    Build indexes on the new table.
5.    Apply all changes recorded in the log table to the new table.
6.    Swap the tables, including indexes and toast tables, using the system catalogs.
7.    Drop the original table. 

During these steps, pg_repack will only hold an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock for a short period during the initial setup (steps 1 and 2) and the final swap-and-drop phase (steps 6 and 7). For the rest of the time, pg_repack will only need to hold an ACCESS SHARE lock on the original table, allowing INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs to proceed as usual.

### Limitations

pg_repack has some limitations that you should be aware of before using it:

-  The pg_repack extension can't be used to repack the default database named `postgres`. This is due to pg_repack not having the necessary permissions to operate against extensions installed by default on this database. The extension can be created in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, but it can't run.
-  The target table must have either a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index on a NOT NULL column for the operation to be successful.
-  While pg_repack is running, you won't be able to perform any DDL commands on the target table(s) except for VACUUM or ANALYZE. To ensure these restrictions are enforced, pg_repack will hold an ACCESS SHARE lock on the target table during a
     full table repack.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To enable the pg_repack extension, follow the steps below:

1. Add pg_repack extension under Azure extensions as shown below from the server parameters blade on the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server portal.

> [!NOTE]  
> Making this change doesn't require a server restart.

### Install the packages for Ubuntu virtual machine

Using the extension requires a client with psql and pg_repack installed. All examples in this document use an Ubuntu VM with PostgreSQL 11 to 15.

Run the following packages on the Ubuntu machine to install the pg_repack client 1.4.7

```psql
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list' && \
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add - && \
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt install -y postgresql-server-dev-14 && \
sudo apt install -y unzip make gcc && \
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev liblz4-dev zlib1g-dev libreadline-dev && \
wget 'https://api.pgxn.org/dist/pg_repack/1.4.7/pg_repack-1.4.7.zip' && \
unzip pg_repack-1.4.7.zip && \
cd pg_repack-1.4.7 && \
sudo make && \
sudo cp bin/pg_repack /usr/local/bin && \
pg_repack -V
```

## Use pg_repack

Example of how to run pg_repack on a table named info in a public schema within the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance with endpoint pgserver.postgres.database.azure.com, username azureuser, and database foo using the following command.

1. Connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. This article uses psql for simplicity.

    ```psql
        psql "host=xxxxxxxxx.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=foo user=xxxxxxxxxxxxx password=[my_password] sslmode=require"
    ```
2. Create the pg_repack extension in the databases intended to be repacked.

    ```psql
    foo=> create extension pg_repack;
        CREATE EXTENSION
    ```dotnetcli

3. Find the pg_repack version installed on the server.

    ```psql
    foo=> \dx
    List of installed extensions

       Name    | Version |   Schema   |                         Description
 
    -----------+---------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
    
     pg_repack | 1.4.7   | public     | Reorganize tables in PostgreSQL databases with minimal locks
    
     (one row)
    
    This version should match with the pg_repack in the virtual machine. Check this by running the following.
    
    azureuser@azureuser:~$ pg_repack --version
    pg_repack 1.4.7
    ```

4. Run pg_repack client against a table *info* within database *foo*.

    ```psql
    pg_repack --host=xxxxxxxxxxxx.postgres.database.azure.com --username=xxxxxxxxxx --dbname=foo --table=info --jobs=2 --no-kill-backend --no-superuser-check
    ```

### pg_repack options

Useful pg_repack options for production workloads:

- -k, --no-superuser-check
    Skip the superuser checks in the client. This setting is helpful for using pg_repack on platforms that support running it as non-superusers, like Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances.

- -j, --jobs
    Create the specified number of extra connections to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server and use these extra connections to parallelize the rebuild of indexes on each table. Parallel index builds are only supported for full-table repacks.

- --index or --only indexes options
    If your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance has extra cores and disk I/O available, this can be a useful way to speed up pg_repack.

- -D, --no-kill-backend
    Skip to repack table if the lock can't be taken for duration specified --wait-timeout default 60 sec, instead of canceling conflicting queries. The default is false.

- -E LEVEL, --elevel=LEVEL
    Choose the output message level from DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR, LOG, FATAL, and PANIC. The default is INFO.

To understand all the options, refer to [pg_repack options](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/)
