# Networking overview for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server with public access (allowed IP addresses)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

This article describes connectivity and networking concepts for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

When you create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance, you must choose one of the following networking options: **Private access (VNet integration)** or **Public access (allowed IP addresses) and Private Endpoint**.  
The following characteristics apply whether you choose to use the private access or the public access option:

- Connections from allowed IP addresses need to authenticate to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance with valid credentials.
- Connection encryption is enforced for your network traffic.
- The server has a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For the `hostname` property in connection strings, we recommend using the FQDN instead of an IP address.
- Both options control access at the server level, not at the database  or table level. You would use PostgreSQL's roles properties to control database, table, and other object access.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server is a managed database service, users are not provided host or OS access to view or modify configuration files such as `pg_hba.conf`. The content of the files is automatically updated based on the network settings.

## Use Public Access Networking with Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server

When you choose the **Public Access** method, your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance is accessed through a public endpoint over the internet. The public endpoint is a publicly resolvable DNS address. The phrase **allowed IP addresses** refers to a range of IP addresses that you choose to give permission to access your server. These permissions are called *firewall rules*.

Choose this networking option if you want the following capabilities:

- Connect from Azure resources that don't support virtual networks.
- Connect from resources outside Azure that are not connected by VPN or ExpressRoute.
- Ensure that the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance has a public endpoint that's accessible through the internet.

Characteristics of the public access method include:

- Only the IP addresses that you allow have permission to access your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. By default, no IP addresses are allowed. You can add IP addresses during server creation or afterward.
- Your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance has a publicly resolvable DNS name.
- Your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance is not in one of your Azure virtual networks.
- Network traffic to and from your server does not go over a private network. The traffic uses the general internet pathways.

### Firewall rules

Server-level firewall rules apply to all databases on the same Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. If the source IP address of the request is within one of the ranges specified in the server-level firewall rules, the connection is granted otherwise it is rejected. For example, if your application connects with JDBC driver for PostgreSQL, you may encounter this error attempting to connect when the firewall is blocking the connection.
```java
java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "123.45.67.890", user "adminuser", database "postgresql", SSL
```
> [!NOTE]
> To access Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server from your local computer, ensure that the firewall on your network and local computer allow outgoing communication on TCP port 5432.

### Programmatically managed Firewall rules
In addition to the Azure portal, firewall rules can be managed programmatically using Azure CLI. See [Create and manage Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server firewall rules using the Azure CLI](./how-to-manage-firewall-cli.md)

### Allow all Azure IP addresses

It is recommended that you find the outgoing IP address of any application or service and explicitly allow access to those individual IP addresses or ranges. If a fixed outgoing IP address isn't available for your Azure service, you can consider enabling connections from all IP addresses for Azure datacenters.
This setting can be enabled from the Azure portal by checking the **Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server** checkbox on **Networking pane** and hitting **Save**. 
 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Allow public access from Azure services and resources within Azure** option configures the firewall to allow all connections from Azure, including connections from the subscriptions of other customers. When you select this option, make sure that your sign-in and user permissions limit access to only authorized users.

### Troubleshoot public access issues

Consider the following points when access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server doesn't behave as you expect:

- **Changes to the allowlist haven't taken effect yet**. There might be as much as a five-minute delay for changes to the firewall configuration of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance to take effect.

- **Authentication failed**. If a user doesn't have permissions on the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance or the password is incorrect, the connection to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance is denied. Creating a firewall setting only provides clients with an opportunity to try connecting to your server. Each client must still provide the necessary security credentials.

- **Dynamic client IP address is preventing access**. If you have an internet connection with dynamic IP addressing and you're having trouble getting through the firewall, try one of the following solutions:

   * Ask your internet service provider (ISP) for the IP address range assigned to your client computers that access the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. Then add the IP address range as a firewall rule.
   * Get static IP addressing instead for your client computers, and then add the static IP address as a firewall rule.

- **Firewall rule is not available for IPv6 format**. The firewall rules must be in IPv4 format. If you specify firewall rules in IPv6 format, you'll get a validation error.

## Host name

Regardless of the networking option that you choose, we recommend that you always use an FQDN as host name when connecting to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance. The server's IP address is not guaranteed to remain static. Using the FQDN will help you avoid making changes to your connection string.

An example that uses an FQDN as a host name is `hostname = servername.postgres.database.azure.com`. Where possible, avoid using `hostname = 10.0.0.4` (a private address) or `hostname = 40.2.45.67` (a public address).

## Next steps

- Learn how to create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance by using the **Public access (allowed IP addresses)** option in [the Azure portal](how-to-manage-firewall-portal.md) or [the Azure CLI](how-to-manage-firewall-cli.md).
