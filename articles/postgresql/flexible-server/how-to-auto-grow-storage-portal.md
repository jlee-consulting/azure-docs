# Storage autogrow using Azure portal in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server


[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-Flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]


This article describes how you can configure Azure Database for PostgreSQL server storage to grow without impacting the workload.

For servers with more than 1 TiB of provisioned storage, the storage autogrow mechanism activates when the available space falls to less than 10% of the total capacity or 64 GiB of free space, whichever of the two values is smaller. Conversely, for servers with storage under 1 TB, this threshold is adjusted to 20% of the available free space or 64 GiB, depending on which of these values is smaller.

As an illustration, take a server with a storage capacity of 2 TiB ( greater than one TiB). In this case, the autogrow limit is set at 64 GiB. This choice is made because 64 GiB is the smaller value when compared to 10% of 2 TiB, which is roughly 204.8 GiB. In contrast, for a server with a storage size of 128 GiB (less than 1 TiB), the autogrow feature activates when there's only 25.8 GiB of space left. This activation is based on the 20% threshold of the total allocated storage (128 GiB), which is smaller than 64 GiB. 


> [!NOTE]  
> Storage always doubles in size for premium disk SSD which doubles the storage cost. Only premium SSD V2 supports incremental disk size increase.

## Enable storage autogrow for existing servers

Follow these steps to enable Storage Autogrow on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.

2. On the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server page, select **Compute + storage**

3. In the **Storage Autogrowth** section, checkmark to enable storage autogrow.

4. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

5. A notification confirms that auto grow was successfully enabled.

  
## Enable storage autogrow during server provisioning

1. In the Azure portal, during server provisioning, under **Compute + storage** select  **Configure server**
