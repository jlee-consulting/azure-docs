# Quickstart: Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server by using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [azure-database-for-postgresql-single-server-deprecation](../includes/azure-database-for-postgresql-single-server-deprecation.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Please be aware that as part of the ongoing retirement process for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server, the option to create new instances via the Azure portal is no longer available.
> While portal-based creation is discontinued, you can continue to create Single Server instances using methods such as [Azure CLI](quickstart-create-server-database-azure-cli.md), [Azure CLI up command](quickstart-create-server-up-azure-cli.md) or the [ARM template](quickstart-create-postgresql-server-database-using-arm-template.md). However, please note that as of March 2025, these methods will also no longer be used for creating new instances.
