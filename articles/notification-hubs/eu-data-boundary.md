# EU Data Boundary

The EU Data Boundary (EUDB) is a response to increasing concerns about the transnational transfer of European Union customer personal data. Microsoft strives to foster trust in its services by limiting data transfer.

## EUDB in Azure

If you use the Azure portal to create an Azure Notification Hubs namespace in an EU country, your data will remain in the EU region, and will not be transferred outside the EU data boundary. A full list of countries in scope for EUDB is as follows:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Republic of Cyprus
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Greece
- Hungary
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Malta
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Portugal
- Romania
- Slovakia
- Slovenia
- Spain
- Sweden
