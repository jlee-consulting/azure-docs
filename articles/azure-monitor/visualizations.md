# Visualize data from Azure Monitor
This article summarizes the available methods to visualize metric and log data stored in Azure Monitor.

Visualizations such as charts and graphs can help you analyze your monitoring data to drill down on issues and identify patterns. Depending on the tool that you use, you might also have the option to share visualizations with other users inside and outside your organization.

## Workbooks
[Workbooks](./visualize/workbooks-overview.md) are interactive documents that provide deep insights into your data, investigation, and collaboration inside the team. Workbooks are especially useful for troubleshooting guides and incident postmortems.

Advantages of a workbook include:

- Support for both metrics and logs.
- Support for parameters that enable interactive reports, where selecting an element in a table will dynamically update associated charts and visualizations.
- Document-like flow.
- Options for personal or shared workbooks.
- Easy, collaborative authoring experience.
- Templates that support a public GitHub-based template gallery.


## Azure Dashboards
[Azure dashboards](../azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards.md) are the primary dashboarding technology for Azure. They're useful in providing a single pane of glass over your Azure infrastructure and services, so you can quickly identify important issues.

Here's a video walkthrough on creating dashboards:

Advantages of a dashboard include:

- Deep integration into Azure. Visualizations can be pinned to dashboards from multiple Azure pages, including [Metrics Explorer](essentials/metrics-charts.md), [Log Analytics](logs/log-analytics-overview.md), and [Application Insights](app/app-insights-overview.md).
- Support for both metrics and logs.
- The ability to combine data from multiple sources, including output from [Metrics Explorer](essentials/metrics-charts.md), [log queries](logs/log-query-overview.md), and [maps](app/app-map.md), and availability in [Application Insights](app/app-insights-overview.md).
- Options for personal or shared dashboards through integration with [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md).
- Automatic refresh. Metric refresh depends on the time range, with a minimum of five minutes. Logs refresh every hour. You can manually refresh on demand by selecting the **Refresh** icon on a visualization, or by refreshing the full dashboard.
- Parameterized metric dashboards with time stamps and custom parameters.
- Flexible layout options.
- Full-screen mode.


Limitations include:

- Limited control over log visualizations, with no support for data tables. The total number of data series is limited to 50, with further data series grouped under an _other_ bucket.
- No custom parameter support for log charts.
- A limited period for log charts (last 30 days).
- A requirement that log charts must be pinned to shared dashboards.
- No interactivity with dashboard data.
- Limited contextual drill-down.


## Power BI
[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-service-get-started/) is useful for creating business-centric dashboards and reports, along with reports that analyze long-term KPI trends. You can [import the results of a log query](visualize/powerbi.md) into a Power BI dataset and then take advantage of its features, such as combining data from different sources and sharing reports on the web and mobile devices.

Advantages of Power BI include:

- Rich visualizations.
- Extensive interactivity, including zoom-in and cross-filtering.
- Ease of sharing throughout your organization.
- Integration with other data from multiple data sources.
- Better performance with results cached in a cube.

Limitations include:

- Support for logs but not metrics.
- No Azure integration. You can't manage dashboards and models through Azure Resource Manager.
- The need for query results to be imported into a Power BI model for configuration. 
- Limited result size and refresh.
- Limited data refresh (eight times per day).


## Grafana
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open platform that excels in operational dashboards. It's useful for detecting, isolating, and triaging operational incidents. You can add the [Azure Monitor data source plug-in for Grafana](visualize/grafana-plugin.md) to your Azure subscription to have it visualize your Azure metric data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Internet Explorer browser and older Microsoft Edge browsers are not compatible with Grafana. You must use a Chromium-based browser, including Microsoft Edge. See [Supported browsers for Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/requirements/#supported-web-browsers).

Advantages of Grafana include:

- Rich visualizations.
- A rich ecosystem of data sources.
- Data interactivity, including zoom-in.
- Support for parameters.

Limitations include:

- No Azure integration. You can't manage dashboards and models through Azure Resource Manager.
- The cost to support additional Grafana infrastructure or additional cost for Grafana Cloud.

## Azure Monitor partners
Some Azure Monitor partners provide visualization functionality. For a list of partners that Microsoft has evaluated, see [Azure Monitor partner integrations](./partners.md). 

An Azure Monitor partner might provide out-of-the-box visualizations to save you time. 

Limitations include:

- Potential for additional costs.
- The need for time to research and evaluate partner offerings.

## Your own custom application
You can access metric and log data in Azure Monitor through an API by using any REST client. You can then build your own custom websites and applications.

Advantages of building a custom application include:

- Complete flexibility in UI, visualization, interactivity, and features.
- The ability to combine metric and log data with other data sources.

One significant disadvantage is that it requires engineering effort.

## Azure Monitor views

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Views are in the process of being deprecated. For guidance on converting views to workbooks, see the [transition guide](visualize/view-designer-conversion-overview.md).

[Views in Azure Monitor](visualize/view-designer.md) allow you to create custom visualizations by using log data. [Monitoring solutions](insights/solutions.md) use views to present the data that they collect.


![Screenshot that shows a Container Monitoring Solution tile and the detailed Azure Monitor view that opens when you select it.](media/visualizations/view.png)

Advantages of views include:

- Rich visualizations for log data.
- The ability to export and import views, to transfer them to other resource groups and subscriptions.
- Integration into the Azure Monitor management model, with workspaces and monitoring solutions.
- [Filters](visualize/view-designer-filters.md) for custom parameters.
- Interactivity, with support for multilevel drill-in (a view that drills into another view).

Limitations include:

- Support for logs but not metrics.
- No personal views. A view is available to all users with access to the workspace.
- No automatic refresh.
- Limited layout options.
- No support for querying across multiple workspaces or Application Insights applications.
- Limited query response size (8 MB) and query execution time (110 seconds).
