# Migrate to Azure Monitor Agent from Log Analytics agent

[Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](./agents-overview.md) replaces the Log Analytics agent (also known as MMA and OMS) for both Windows and Linux machines, in both Azure and non-Azure (on-premises and third-party clouds) environments. It introduces a simplified, flexible method of configuring collection configuration called [data collection rules (DCRs)](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md). This article outlines the benefits of migrating to Azure Monitor Agent and provides guidance on how to implement a successful migration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Log Analytics agent will be [retired on **August 31, 2024**](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/were-retiring-the-log-analytics-agent-in-azure-monitor-on-31-august-2024/). If you're currently using the Log Analytics agent with Azure Monitor or other supported features and services, you should start planning your migration to Azure Monitor Agent by using the information in this article.

## Benefits

Azure Monitor Agent provides the following benefits over legacy agents:

- **Security and performance**
  - Enhanced security through Managed Identity and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens (for clients).
  - A higher events-per-second (EPS) upload rate.
- **Cost savings** by [using data collection rules](data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md). Using DCRs is one of the most useful advantages of using Azure Monitor Agent:
  - DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the "all or nothing" approach of legacy agents.
  - With DCRs, you can define which data to ingest and which data to filter out to reduce workspace clutter and save on costs.
- **Simpler management** of data collection, including ease of troubleshooting:
  - Easy *multihoming* on Windows and Linux.
  - Centralized, "in the cloud" agent configuration makes every action simpler and more easily scalable throughout the data collection lifecycle, from onboarding to deployment to updates and changes over time.
  - Greater transparency and control of more capabilities and services, such as Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and VM Insights.
- **A single agent** that consolidates all features necessary to address all telemetry data collection needs across servers and client devices running Windows 10 or 11. A single agent is the goal, although Azure Monitor Agent currently converges with the Log Analytics agents.

## Migration plan considerations

Your migration plan to the Azure Monitor Agent should take into account:

- **Current and new feature requirements:** Review [Azure Monitor Agent's supported services and features](agents-overview.md#supported-services-and-features) to ensure that Azure Monitor Agent has the features you require. If you currently use unsupported features you can temporarily do without, consider migrating to the new agent to benefit from added security and reduced cost immediately. Use the [AMA Migration Helper](./azure-monitor-agent-migration-tools.md#using-ama-migration-helper-preview) to *discover what solutions and features you're using today that depend on the legacy agent*.

    If you use Microsoft Sentinel, see [Gap analysis for Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/ama-migrate.md#gap-analysis-between-agents) for a comparison of the extra data collected by Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Installing Azure Monitor Agent alongside a legacy agent:** If you're setting up a *new environment* with resources, such as deployment scripts and onboarding templates, and you still need a legacy agent, assess the effort of migrating to Azure Monitor Agent later. If the setup will take a significant amount of rework, install Azure Monitor Agent together with a legacy agent in your new environment to decrease the migration effort.

    Azure Monitor Agent can run alongside the legacy Log Analytics agents on the same machine so that you can continue to use existing functionality during evaluation or migration. You can begin the transition, but ensure you understand the limitations:
    - Be careful when you collect duplicate data from the same machine. Duplicate data could skew query results and affect downstream features like alerts, dashboards, or workbooks. For example, VM Insights uses the Log Analytics agent to send performance data to a Log Analytics workspace. You might also have configured the workspace to collect Windows events and Syslog events from agents.
    If you install Azure Monitor Agent and create a data collection rule for these events and performance data, you'll collect duplicate data. If you're using both agents to collect the same type of data, make sure the agents are *collecting data from different machines* or *sending the data to different destinations*. Collecting duplicate data also generates more charges for data ingestion and retention.
    
    - Running two telemetry agents on the same machine consumes double the resources, including but not limited to CPU, memory, storage space, and network bandwidth.

## Prerequisites

Review the [prerequisites](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#prerequisites) for use with Azure Monitor Agent. For non-Azure servers, [installing the Azure Arc agent](../../azure-arc/servers/agent-overview.md) is an important prerequisite that then helps to install the agent extension and other required extensions. Using Azure Arc for this purpose comes at no added cost. It's not mandatory to use Azure Arc for server management overall. You can continue using your existing non-Azure management solutions. After the Azure Arc agent is installed, you can follow the same guidance in this article across Azure and non-Azure for migration.

## Migration testing

To ensure safe deployment during migration, begin testing with few resources running Azure Monitor Agent in your nonproduction environment. After you validate the data collected on these test resources, roll out to production by following the same steps.

To start collecting some of the existing data types, see [Create new data collection rules](./data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md#create-data-collection-rule-and-association). Alternatively, you can use the [DCR Config Generator](./azure-monitor-agent-migration-tools.md#installing-and-using-dcr-config-generator-preview) to convert existing legacy agent configuration into data collection rules.

After you *validate* that data is flowing as expected with Azure Monitor Agent, check the `Category` column in the [Heartbeat](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/heartbeat) table for the value *Azure Monitor Agent* for AMA collected data. Ensure it matches data flowing through the existing Log Analytics agent.

## At-scale migration using Azure Policy

We recommend using [Azure Policy](../../governance/policy/overview.md) to migrate a large number of agents. Start by analyzing your current monitoring setup with the Log Analytics agent by using the [AMA Migration Helper](./azure-monitor-agent-migration-tools.md#using-ama-migration-helper-preview). Use this tool to find sources like virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and non-Azure servers.

Use the [DCR Config Generator](./azure-monitor-agent-migration-tools.md#installing-and-using-dcr-config-generator-preview) to migrate legacy agent configuration, including data sources and destinations, from the workspace to the new DCRs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you deploy a large number of agents, consider [configuring the workspace](agent-data-sources.md) to disable data collection for the Log Analytics agent. If you leave data collection for the Log Analytics agent enabled, you might collect duplicate data and increase your costs. You might choose to collect duplicate data for a short period during migration until you verify that you've deployed and configured Azure Monitor Agent correctly.

Validate that Azure Monitor Agent is collecting data as expected and all downstream dependencies, such as dashboards, alerts, and workbooks, function properly.

After you confirm that Azure Monitor Agent is collecting data properly, [uninstall the Log Analytics agent](./agent-manage.md#uninstall-agent) from monitored resources. Clean up any configuration files, workspace keys, or certificates that were used previously by the Log Analytics agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't uninstall the legacy agent if you need to use it for System Center Operations Manager scenarios or others solutions not yet available on Azure Monitor Agent.
