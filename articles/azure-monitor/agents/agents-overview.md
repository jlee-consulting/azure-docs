# Azure Monitor Agent overview

Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) collects monitoring data from the guest operating system of Azure and hybrid virtual machines and delivers it to Azure Monitor for use by features, insights, and other services, such as [Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentintel/../sentinel/overview.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction.md). Azure Monitor Agent replaces all of Azure Monitor's legacy monitoring agents. This article provides an overview of Azure Monitor Agent's capabilities and supported use cases.

Here's a short **introduction to Azure Monitor video**, which includes a quick demo of how to set up the agent from the Azure portal:  [ITOps Talk: Azure Monitor Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8bIrFU8tCs)

## Consolidating legacy agents

Deploy Azure Monitor Agent on all new virtual machines, scale sets and on premise servers to collect data for [supported services and features](#supported-services-and-features).

If you have machines already deployed with legacy Log Analytics agents, we recommend you [migrate to Azure Monitor Agent](./azure-monitor-agent-migration.md) as soon as possible. The legacy Log Analytics agent will not be supported after August 2024.

Azure Monitor Agent replaces the Azure Monitor legacy monitoring agents:

- [Log Analytics Agent](./log-analytics-agent.md): Sends data to a Log Analytics workspace and supports monitoring solutions. This is fully consolidated into Azure Monitor agent. 
- [Telegraf agent](../essentials/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md): Sends data to Azure Monitor Metrics (Linux only). Only basic Telegraf plugins are supported today in Azure Monitor agent.
- [Diagnostics extension](./diagnostics-extension-overview.md): Sends data to Azure Monitor Metrics (Windows only), Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Storage. This is not consolidated yet.

## Install the agent and configure data collection  

Azure Monitor Agent uses [data collection rules](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md), using which you define which data you want each agent to collect. Data collection rules let you manage data collection settings at scale and define unique, scoped configurations for subsets of machines. The rules are independent of the workspace and the virtual machine, which means you can define a rule once and reuse it across machines and environments. 

**To collect data using Azure Monitor Agent:**

1. Install the agent on the resource.

    | Resource type | Installation method | More information |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | Virtual machines, scale sets | [Virtual machine extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#virtual-machine-extension-details) | Installs the agent by using Azure extension framework. |
    | On-premises servers (Azure Arc-enabled servers) | [Virtual machine extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#virtual-machine-extension-details) (after installing the [Azure Arc agent](../../azure-arc/servers/deployment-options.md)) | Installs the agent by using Azure extension framework, provided for on-premises by first installing [Azure Arc agent](../../azure-arc/servers/deployment-options.md). |
    | Windows 10, 11 desktops, workstations | [Client installer (Public preview)](./azure-monitor-agent-windows-client.md) | Installs the agent by using a Windows MSI installer. |
    | Windows 10, 11 laptops | [Client installer (Public preview)](./azure-monitor-agent-windows-client.md) | Installs the agent by using a Windows MSI installer. The installer works on laptops, but the agent *isn't optimized yet* for battery or network consumption. |
    
1. Define a data collection rule and associate the resource to the rule.

    The table below lists the types of data you can currently collect with the Azure Monitor Agent and where you can send that data.

    | Data source | Destinations | Description |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | Performance        | Azure Monitor Metrics (Public preview)<sup>1</sup> - Insights.virtualmachine namespace<br>Log Analytics workspace - [Perf](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/perf) table | Numerical values measuring performance of different aspects of operating system and workloads |
    | Windows event logs (including sysmon events) | Log Analytics workspace - [Event](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/Event) table | Information sent to the Windows event logging system |
    | Syslog             | Log Analytics workspace - [Syslog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/syslog)<sup>2</sup> table | Information sent to the Linux event logging system |
    | Text logs | Log Analytics workspace - custom table | Events sent to log file on agent machine |
    
    <sup>1</sup> On Linux, using Azure Monitor Metrics as the only destination is supported in v1.10.9.0 or higher.<br>
    <sup>2</sup> Azure Monitor Linux Agent versions 1.15.2 and higher support syslog RFC formats including Cisco Meraki, Cisco ASA, Cisco FTD, Sophos XG, Juniper Networks, Corelight Zeek, CipherTrust, NXLog, McAfee, and Common Event Format (CEF).

    >[!NOTE]
    >On rsyslog-based systems, Azure Monitor Linux Agent adds forwarding rules to the default ruleset defined in the rsyslog configuration. If multiple rulesets are used, inputs bound to non-default ruleset(s) are **not** forwarded to Azure Monitor Agent. For more information about multiple rulesets in rsyslog, see the [official documentation](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/concepts/multi_ruleset.html).

## Supported regions

Azure Monitor Agent is available in all public regions and Azure Government clouds. It's not yet supported in air-gapped clouds. For more information, see [Product availability by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=monitor&rar=true&regions=all).
## Costs

There's no cost for the Azure Monitor Agent, but you might incur charges for the data ingested. For information on Log Analytics data collection and retention and for customer metrics, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

<sup>1</sup> To review other limitations of using Azure Monitor Metrics, see [quotas and limits](../essentials/metrics-custom-overview.md#quotas-and-limits). On Linux, using Azure Monitor Metrics as the only destination is supported in v.1.10.9.0 or higher.

### Supported operating systems

The following tables list the operating systems that Azure Monitor Agent and the legacy agents support. All operating systems are assumed to be x64. x86 isn't supported for any operating system.  
View [supported operating systems for Azure Arc Connected Machine agent](../../azure-arc/servers/prerequisites.md#supported-operating-systems), which is a prerequisite to run Azure Monitor agent on physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure (that is, on-premises) or in other clouds.

<sup>1</sup> Requires Python (2 or 3) to be installed on the machine.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Requires Python 2 to be installed on the machine and aliased to the `python` command.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Also supported on Arm64-based machines.

>[!NOTE]
>Machines and appliances that run heavily customized or stripped-down versions of the above distributions and hosted solutions that disallow customization by the user are not supported. Azure Monitor and legacy agents rely on various packages and other baseline functionality that is often removed from such systems, and their installation may require some environmental modifications considered to be disallowed by the appliance vendor. For instance, [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server) is not supported due to heavy customization as well as [documented, license-level disallowance](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/overview/system-overview#operating-system-software-and-patches) of operating system modification.

## Next steps

- [Install the Azure Monitor Agent](azure-monitor-agent-manage.md) on Windows and Linux virtual machines.
- [Create a data collection rule](data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md) to collect data from the agent and send it to Azure Monitor.
