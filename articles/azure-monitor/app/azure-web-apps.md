# Application monitoring for Azure App Service overview

It's now easier than ever to enable monitoring on your web applications based on ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, and Node.js running on [Azure App Service](../../app-service/index.yml). Previously, you needed to manually instrument your app, but the latest extension/agent is now built into the App Service image by default.

## Enable Application Insights

There are two ways to enable monitoring for applications hosted on App Service:

- **Auto-instrumentation application monitoring** (ApplicationInsightsAgent).

  This method is the easiest to enable, and no code change or advanced configurations are required. It's often referred to as "runtime" monitoring. For App Service, we recommend that at a minimum you enable this level of monitoring. Based on your specific scenario, you can evaluate whether more advanced monitoring through manual instrumentation is needed.

  For a complete list of supported auto-instrumentation scenarios, see [Supported environments, languages, and resource providers](codeless-overview.md#supported-environments-languages-and-resource-providers).

  The following platforms are supported for auto-instrumentation monitoring:

  - [.NET Core](./azure-web-apps-net-core.md)
  - [.NET](./azure-web-apps-net.md)
  - [Java](./azure-web-apps-java.md)
  - [Node.js](./azure-web-apps-nodejs.md)

* **Manually instrumenting the application through code** by installing the Application Insights SDK.

  This approach is much more customizable, but it requires the following approaches: SDK for [.NET Core](./asp-net-core.md), [.NET](./asp-net.md), [Node.js](./nodejs.md), [Python](./opencensus-python.md), and a standalone agent for [Java](./java-in-process-agent.md). This method also means you must manage the updates to the latest version of the packages yourself.
  
  If you need to make custom API calls to track events/dependencies not captured by default with auto-instrumentation monitoring, you'll need to use this method. To learn more, see [Application Insights API for custom events and metrics](./api-custom-events-metrics.md).

If both auto-instrumentation monitoring and manual SDK-based instrumentation are detected, in .NET only the manual instrumentation settings will be honored, while in Java only the auto-instrumentation will be emitting the telemetry. This practice is to prevent duplicate data from being sent.

> [!NOTE]
> Snapshot Debugger and Profiler are only available in .NET and .NET Core.
