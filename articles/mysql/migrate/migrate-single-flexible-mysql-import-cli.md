# Migrate Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server to Flexible Server using Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-mysql-single-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-single-server.md)]

Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI (Generally Available) enables you to migrate your Azure Database for MySQL seamlessly - Single Server to Flexible Server. It uses snapshot backup and restores technology to offer a simple and fast migration path to restore the source server's physical data files to the target server. Post import operation, you can take advantage of the benefits of Flexible Server, including better price & performance, granular control over database configuration, and custom maintenance windows.

Based on user-inputs, it takes up the responsibility of provisioning your target Flexible Server and then taking the backup of the source server and restoring the target. It copies the data files, server parameters, compatible firewall rules and server properties - tier, version, sku-name, storage-size, location, geo-redundant-backup, public-access, tags, auto grow, backup-retention-days, admin-user and admin-password from Single to Flexible Server instance.

Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI supports a near-zero downtime migration by first performing an offline import operation and consequently users can set up data-in replication between source and target to perform an online migration.

This tutorial shows how to use the Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI command to migrate your Azure Database for MySQL Single Server to Flexible Server.

## What's new?

- Azure Database for MySQL Import operation for Single Servers with Legacy Storage architecture (General Purpose storage V1) is now supported. You need to set the parameter log_bin=ON for your Single Server instance with Legacy Storage before initiating the import operation. In order to do so, create a read replica for your Single Server instance and then delete it. This operation will set the parameter log_bin to ON and you can then trigger an import operation to migrate to Flexible Server. (Feb 2024)

## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md) is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also open Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/bash](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and select **Enter** to run it.

If you prefer to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.54.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Setup

You must sign in to your account using the [az sign-in](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. Note the **id** property, which refers to your Azure account's **Subscription ID**.

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

Select the specific subscription in which the source Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server resides under your account using the [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) command. Note the **id** value from the **az login** output to use as the value for the **subscription** argument in the command. If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the appropriate subscription in which the source Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server resides. To get all your subscriptions, use [az account list](/cli/azure/account#az-account-list).

```azurecli-interactive
az account set --subscription <subscription id>
```

## Limitations and pre-requisites

- If your source Azure Database for MySQL Single Server has engine version v8.x, ensure to upgrade your source server's .NET client driver version to 8.0.32 to avoid any encoding incompatibilities post migration to Flexible Server.
- The source Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server and the target Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server must be in the same subscription, resource group, region, and on the same MySQL version. Import across subscriptions, resource groups, regions, and versions isn't possible.
- MySQL versions supported by Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI are 5.7 and 8.0. If you are on a different major MySQL version on Single Server, make sure to upgrade your version on your Single Server instance before triggering the import command.
- If the Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server instance has server parameter 'lower_case_table_names' set to 2 and your application used partition tables, Import operation will result in corrupted partition tables. The recommendation is to set 'lower_case_table_names' to 1 for your Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server instance in order to proceed with corruption-free MySQL Import operation.
- Import to an existing Azure MySQL Flexible Server isn't supported. The CLI command initiates the import of a new Azure MySQL Flexible Server.
- If the flexible target server is provisioned as non-HA (High Availability disabled) when updating the CLI command parameters, it can later be switched to Same-Zone HA but not Zone-Redundant HA.
- For CMK enabled Single Server instances, Azure Database for MySQL Import command requires you to provide mandatory input parameters for enabling CMK on target Flexible Server.
- If the Single Server instance has ' Infrastructure Double Encryption' enabled, enabling Customer Managed Key (CMK) on target Flexible Server instance is recommended to support similar functionality. You can choose to enable CMK on target server with Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI input parameters or post migration as well.
- If the Single Server instance has 'Query Store' enabled, enabling slow query logs on target Flexible Server instance is recommended to support similar functionality. You can configure slow query logs on the target flexible server by following steps [here](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/tutorial-query-performance-insights#configure-slow-query-logs-by-using-the-azure-portal). You can then view query insights by using [workbooks template](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/tutorial-query-performance-insights#view-query-insights-by-using-workbooks).
- If your Single Server instance has Legacy Storage architecture (General Purpose storage V1), you need to set the parameter log_bin=ON for your Single Server instance before initiating the import operation. In order to do so, create a read replica for your Single Server instance and then delete it. This operation will set the parameter log_bin to ON and you can then trigger an import operation to migrate to Flexible Server.
- If your Single Server instance has Advanced Threat Protection enabled, you need to enable Advanced Threat Protection on the migrated Flexible Server instance post migration by following steps [here] (/azure/mysql/flexible-server/advanced-threat-protection-setting?view=azure-cli-latest).
- If your Single Server instance has engine version v8.0, consider performing the following actions to avoid any breaking changes due to community minor version differences between the Single and Flexible Server instance :

  - Run the following statement to check if your instance could be affected by erroneous histogram information. If the corresponding tables are output, we recommend that you refer to [https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/histogram-statistics-in-mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/histogram-statistics-in-mysql/) to delete the histogram information, and then recreate it on the Flexible Server. It's worth noting that the histogram inf` is only statistical information about the columns, and this information only exists in system tables, so deleting the histogram info will not affect the table data.

    ```sql
        SELECT DISTINCT SCHEMA_NAME, TABLE_NAME FROM `information_schema`.`column_statistics`;
    ```

  - Run the following command to check for tables that could have their table column order be disorganized. If this check identifies any affected tables, you need to dump all the data from these tables and then import it back. Failure to do so can lead to the sequence of columns in the binlog not matching the sequence of columns in the user tables. This discrepancy can prevent users from setting up replication, restoring data, enabling High Availability (HA), and other operations.

    ```sql
        SELECT table_schema, table_name, COUNT(*) AS column_count, MAX(ORDINAL_POSITION) AS max_ordinal_position
        FROM information_schema.columns
        GROUP BY table_schema, table_name
        HAVING column_count != max_ordinal_position;
    ```

- Only instance-level import is supported. No option to import selected databases within an instance is provided.
- Below items should be copied from source to target by the user post the Import operation:
  - Read-Replicas
  - Monitoring page settings (Alerts, Metrics, and Diagnostic settings)
  - Any Terraform/CLI scripts hosted by you to manage your Single Server instance should be updated with Flexible Server references

## Trigger an Azure Database for MySQL Import operation to migrate from Azure Database for MySQL - Single Server to Flexible Server

Trigger an Azure Database for MySQL Import operation with the `az mysql flexible-server import create` command. The following command creates a target Flexible Server and performs instance-level import from source to target destination using service defaults and values from your Azure CLI's local context:

```azurecli
az mysql flexible-server import create --data-source-type
                                --data-source
                                --resource-group
                                --name
                                [--sku-name]
                                [--tier]
                                [--version]
                                [--storage-size]
                                [--mode]
                                [--admin-password]
                                [--admin-user]
                                [--auto-scale-iops {Disabled, Enabled}]
                                [--backup-identity]
                                [--backup-key]
                                [--backup-retention]
                                [--database-name]
                                [--geo-redundant-backup {Disabled, Enabled}]
                                [--high-availability {Disabled, SameZone, ZoneRedundant}]
                                [--identity]
                                [--iops]
                                [--key]
                                [--location]
                                [--private-dns-zone]
                                [--public-access]
                                [--resource-group]
                                [--standby-zone]
                                [--storage-auto-grow {Disabled, Enabled}]
                                [--subnet]
                                [--subnet-prefixes]
                                [--tags]
                                [--vnet]
                                [--zone]
```

The following example takes in the data source information for Single Server named 'test-single-server' and target Flexible Server information, creates a target Flexible Server named `test-flexible-server` in the `westus` location (same location as that of the source Single Server) and performs an import from source to target. Azure Database MySQL Import command maps over the corresponding tier, version, sku-name, storage-size, location, geo-redundant-backup, public-access, tags, auto grow, backup-retention-days, admin-user and admin-password properties from Single Server to Flexible Server as smart defaults if no inputs are provided to the CLI command. You can choose to override the smart defaults by providing inputs for these optional parameters.

```azurecli-interactive
az mysql flexible-server import create --data-source-type "mysql_single" --data-source "test-single-server" --resource-group "test-rg"  --name "test-flexible-server"
```

The following example takes in the data source information for Single Server named 'test-single-server' and target Flexible Server information, creates a target Flexible Server named `test-flexible-server` in the `westus` location (same location as that of the source Single Server) with Zone Redundancy enabled and virtual network integration and performs an import from source to target. Learn more about virtual network configuration [here](../flexible-server/how-to-manage-virtual-network-cli.md).

```azurecli-interactive
# create vnet
az network vnet create --resource-group testGroup --name myVnet --location testLocation --address-prefixes 172.0.0.0/16

# create subnet
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group testGroup --vnet-name myVnet --address-prefixes 172.0.0.0/24 --name mySubnet

# create private dns zone
az network private-dns zone create -g testGroup -n myserver.private.contoso.com

# trigger mysql import
az mysql flexible-server import create --data-source-type "mysql_single" --data-source "test-single-server" --resource-group "test-rg"  --name "test-flexible-server" --high-availability ZoneRedundant --zone 1 --standby-zone 3  --vnet "myVnet" --subnet "mySubnet" --private-dns-zone "myserver.private.contoso.com"
```

The following example takes in the data source information for Single Server named 'test-single-server' with Customer Managed Key (CMK) enabled and target Flexible Server information, creates a target Flexible Server named `test-flexible-server` and performs an import from source to target. For CMK enabled Single Server instances, Azure Database for MySQL Import command requires you to provide mandatory input parameters for enabling CMK : --key keyIdentifierOfTestKey --identity testIdentity.

```azurecli-interactive
# create keyvault
az keyvault create -g testGroup -n testVault --location testLocation \
  --enable-purge-protection true

# create key in keyvault and save its key identifier
keyIdentifier=$(az keyvault key create --name testKey -p software \
  --vault-name testVault --query key.kid -o tsv)

# create identity and save its principalId
identityPrincipalId=$(az identity create -g testGroup --name testIdentity \
  --location testLocation --query principalId -o tsv)

# add testIdentity as an access policy with key permissions 'Wrap Key', 'Unwrap Key', 'Get' and 'List' inside testVault
az keyvault set-policy -g testGroup -n testVault --object-id $identityPrincipalId \
  --key-permissions wrapKey unwrapKey get list

# trigger azure database for mysql import for CMK enabled single server
az mysql flexible-server import create --data-source-type "mysql_single" --data-source "test-single-server" --resource-group "test-rg"  --name "test-flexible-server" --key $keyIdentifier --identity testIdentity
```

Here are the details for the arguments above:

**Setting** | **Sample value** | **Description**

## Steps for online migration

After completing the above-stated Azure Database for MySQL Import operation:

- Log in to the target Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server and run the following command to get the bin-log filename and position corresponding to the backup snapshot used by Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI to restore to the target server.

```sql
CALL mysql.az_show_binlog_file_and_pos_for_mysql_import();
```

- Set up data-in replication between the source and target server instances using bin-log position by following steps listed [here](../flexible-server/how-to-data-in-replication.md) and when replication status reflects that the target server has caught up with the source, stop replication and perform cutover.

## Best practices for configuring Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI command parameters

Before you trigger the Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI command, consider the following parameter configuration guidance to help ensure faster data loads using Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI.

- If you want to override smart defaults, select the compute tier and SKU name for the target flexible server based on the source single server's pricing tier and VCores based on the detail in the following table.

    | Single Server Pricing Tier | Single Server VCores | Flexible Server Tier | Flexible Server SKU Name |
    | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
    | Basic | 1 | Burstable | Standard_B2ms |
    | Basic | 2 | Burstable | Standard_B2ms |
    | General Purpose | 4 | GeneralPurpose | Standard_D4ds_v4 |
    | General Purpose | 8 | GeneralPurpose | Standard_D8ds_v4 |
    | General Purpose | 16 | GeneralPurpose | Standard_D16ds_v4 |
    | General Purpose | 32 | GeneralPurpose | Standard_D32ds_v4 |
    | General Purpose | 64 | GeneralPurpose | Standard_D64ds_v4 |
    | Memory Optimized | 4 | MemoryOptimized | Standard_E4ds_v4 |
    | Memory Optimized | 8 | MemoryOptimized | Standard_E8ds_v4 |
    | Memory Optimized | 16 | MemoryOptimized | Standard_E16ds_v4 |
    | Memory Optimized | 32 | MemoryOptimized | Standard_E32ds_v4 |

- The MySQL version, region, subscription and resource for the target flexible server must be equal to that of the source single server.
- The storage size for target flexible server should be equal to or greater than on the source single server.
- If the Single Server instance has ' Infrastructure Double Encryption' enabled, enabling Customer Managed Key (CMK) on target Flexible Server instance is recommended to support similar functionality. You can choose to enable CMK on target server with Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI input parameters or post migration as well.

## How long does Azure Database for MySQL Import take to migrate my Single Server instance?

Below is the benchmarked performance based on storage size for General Purpose V2 storage architecture. (Servers with General purpose V1 storage will take longer time to migrate as it involves upgrading the storage architecture as well)

  | Single Server Storage Size | Import time |
  | --- | :---: |
  | 1 GiB | 0 min 23 secs |
  | 10 GiB | 4 min 24 secs |
  | 100 GiB | 10 min 29 secs |
  | 500 GiB | 13 min 15 secs |
  | 1 TB | 22 min 56 secs |
  | 10 TB | 2 hrs 5 min 30 secs |

From the table above, as the storage size increases, the time required for data copying also increases, almost in a linear relationship. However, it's important to note that copy speed can be significantly affected by network fluctuations. Therefore, the data provided here should be taken as a reference only.

Below is the benchmarked performance based on varying number of tables for 10 GiB storage size.

  | Number of tables in Single Server instance | Import time |
  | --- | :---: |
  | 100 | 4 min 24 secs |
  | 200 | 4 min 40 secs |
  | 800 | 4 min 52 secs |
  | 14,400 | 17 min 41 secs |
  | 28,800 | 19 min 18 secs |
  | 38,400 | 22 min 50 secs |

As the number of files increases, each file/table in the database might become very small. This will result in a consistent amount of data being transferred, but there will be more frequent file-related operations, which might affect the performance of Azure Database for Mysql Import.

## Post-import steps

- Copy the following properties from the source Single Server to target Flexible Server post Azure Database for MySQL Import operation is completed successfully:
  - Read-Replicas
  - Server parameter value for event_scheduler
  - Monitoring page settings (Alerts, Metrics, and Diagnostic settings)
  - Any Terraform/CLI scripts you host to manage your Single Server instance should be updated with Flexible Server references.
