You can use various methods, such as MySQL dump and restore, MySQL Workbench Export/Import, or Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), to migrate your MySQL databases to Azure Database for MySQL. However, by using a combination of open-source tools such as MySQL dump and restore or mydumper/myloader with Data-in replication, you can migrate your workloads with minimum downtime.

Data-in replication is a technique that replicates data changes from the source server to the destination server based on the binary log file position method. In this scenario, the MySQL instance operating as the source (on which the database changes originate) writes updates and changes as “events” to the binary log. The information in the binary log is stored in different logging formats according to the database changes being recorded. Replicas are configured to read the binary log from the source and to execute the events in the binary log on the replica's local database.

If you set up [Data-in replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-data-in-replication) to synchronize data from a source MySQL server to a target MySQL server, you can do a selective cutover of your applications from the primary (or source database) to the replica (or target database).

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to set up Data-in replication between a source server running AWS RDS for MySQL and a target server running Azure Database for MySQL.

## Performance considerations

Before beginning this tutorial, be sure to consider the performance implications of the location and capacity of the client computer you'll use to perform the operation.

### Client location

Perform dump/restore operations from a client computer that is launched in the same location as the database server:

- For Azure Database for MySQL servers, the client machine should be in the same VNet and the same Availability Zone as the target database server.
- For source Amazon RDS database instances, the client instance should exist in the same Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and Availability Zone as the source database server.
In the above case, you can move dump files between client machines using file transfer protocols (such as FTP or SFTP) or upload them to Azure Blob Storage. To reduce the total migration time, you can compress files before transferring them.

### Client capacity

Regardless of where the client computer is located, it requires adequate compute, I/O, and network capacity to perform the requested operations. The general recommendations are as follows:

- If the dump or restore involves real-time processing of data, for example, compression or decompression, choose an instance class with at least one CPU core per dump/restore thread.
- Ensure that there's enough network bandwidth available to the client instance. We recommend using instance types that support accelerated networking feature. For more information, see the Accelerated Networking section in the [Azure Virtual Machine Networking Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli).
- Ensure that the client machine’s storage layer provides the expected read/write capacity, and we recommend an Azure virtual machine with Premium SSD storage.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need to:

- Install the [mysqlclient](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) on your client computer to create a dump and perform a restore operation on your target Azure Database for MySQL server.
- For larger databases, install [mydumper/myloader](https://centminmod.com/mydumper.html) for parallel dumping and restoring of databases.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Mydumper can only run-on Linux distributions, see [How to install mydumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper#how-to-install-mydumpermyloader).

- Create an instance of Azure Database for MySQL server running version 5.7 or 8.0.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If your target is Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server with zone redundant high availability, note that Data-in replication isn’t supported for this configuration. As a work around, during server creation, set up zone-redundant HA by using the following steps:
    >
    > 1. Create the server with Zone redundant HA enabled.
    > 2. Disable HA.
    > 3. Follow the article to setup data-in replication.
    > 4. Post cutover remove the Data-in replication configuration.
    > 5. Enable HA.

It’s also recommended that you ensure that several parameters and features are configured and set up properly, as described below.

- For compatibility reasons, we recommend having the source and target database servers on the same MySQL version.
- Have a primary key in each table. A lack of primary keys on tables can slow the replication process.
- Make sure the character set of the source and the target database are the same.
- Set the `wait_timeout` parameter to a reasonable time, depending on the amount of data or workload you want to import or migrate.
- Verify that all your tables use InnoDB, as Azure Database for MySQL Server only supports the InnoDB storage engine.
- For tables with many secondary indexes or for tables that are very large, the effects of performance overhead are particularly visible during restore, modify the dump files so that the `CREATE TABLE` statements don't include secondary key definitions, and after importing the data, recreate secondary indexes to avoid the performance penalty during restore process.

Finally, to prepare for Data-in replication:

- Verify that the target Azure Database for MySQL server can connect to the source AWS RDS for MySQL server over port 3306.
- Ensure that the source AWS RDS for MySQL server allows both inbound and outbound traffic on port 3306.
- Make sure you provide [site-to-site connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal) to your source server by using either [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). For more information about creating a virtual network, see the [Virtual Network documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/), and especially the quickstart articles with step-by-step details.
- Configure your source database server’s network security groups to allow the target Azure Database for MySQL’s server IP address.

## Configure the target instance of Azure Database for MySQL

To configure the target instance of Azure Database for MySQL (the target for Data-in replication), perform the following steps:

1. Set the `max_allowed_packet` parameter value to the maximum of **1073741824** (i.e., 1 GB), which will prevent any overflow issues related to long rows.
2. Set the `slow_query_log`, `general_log`, `audit_log_enabled`, and `query_store_capture_mode` parameters to **OFF** during the migration to help eliminate any overhead related to query logging.
3. Scale up the compute size of the target Azure Database for MySQL server to the maximum of 64 vCores to provide additional compute resources when restoring the database dump from the source server.

    You can always scale back the compute to meet your application demands after the migration is complete.

4. Scale up the storage size to get more IOPS during the migration or increase the maximum IOPS for the migration.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Available max IOPS are determined by compute size. For more information, see the IOPS section in [Compute and storage options in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-compute-storage#iops).

## Configure the source AWS RDS for MySQL server

To prepare and configure the MySQL server hosted in AWS RDS (the “source” for Data-in replication), perform the following steps.

1. Confirm that binary logging is enabled on the source AWS RDS for MySQL server by checking that automated backups are enabled or ensure that a read replica exists for the source AWS RDS for MySQL server.
2. Ensure that the binary log files on the source server are retained until after the changes have been applied on the target instance of Azure Database for MySQL.

    With Data-in replication, Azure Database for MySQL doesn’t manage the replication process.

3. To check the binary log retention on the source AWS RDS server to determine the number of hours the binary logs are retained, call the `mysql.rds_show_configuration` stored procedure:

    ```
    mysql> call mysql.rds_show_configuration;
    +------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | name                   | value | description                                                                                               |
    +------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | binlog retention hours | 24    | binlog retention hours specifies the duration in hours before binary logs are automatically deleted.      |
    | source delay           | 0     | source delay specifies replication delay in seconds between current instance and its master.              |
    | target delay           | 0     | target delay specifies replication delay in seconds between current instance and its future read-replica. |
    +------------------------+-------            +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
    ```

4. To configure the binary log retention period, run the `rds_set_configuration` stored procedure to ensure that the binary logs are retained on the source server for the desired length of time, for example:

    ```
    Mysql> Call mysql.rds_set_configuration(‘binlog retention hours’, 96);
    ```

    This is helpful if you’re creating a dump and then restoring, to quickly catch up with the delta changes.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Ensure that there is ample disk space to store the binary logs on the source server, depending on the retention period defined.

There are two ways to take dump of data from the source Amazon RDS for MySQL server. One approach involves taking a  dump of data directly from the source server, while the other approach involves capturing a dump from an AWS RDS for MySQL read replica.

- If you're capturing a dump of data directly from the source server, perform the following steps:

    1. Ensure that you stop the writes from the application for few minutes to get a transactionally consistent dump of data.

       You can also temporarily set the `read_only` parameter to a value of **1** so that writes aren't processed when capturing a dump of data.

    2. After stopping the writes on the source server, collect the binary log file name and offset by running the command `Mysql> Show master status;`.
    3. Save these values to start replication from your Azure Database for MySQL server.
    4. To create a dump of the data execute mysqldump, run the following command:

        ```
        $ mysqldump -h hostname -u username -p –single-transaction –databases dbnames –order-by-primary> dumpname.sql
        ```

- If stopping writes on the source server isn't an option or the performance of dumping data isn’t acceptable on the source server, capture a dump on a replica server by performing the following steps:

    1. Create an AWS MySQL read replica with the same configuration as the source server, and then create the dump there.
    2. Let the AWS RDS for MySQL read replica catch up with the source AWS RDS for MySQL server.
    3. When the replica lag reaches **0** on the read replica, stop replication by calling the `mysql.rds_stop_replication` stored procedure.

        ```
        Mysql> call mysql.rds_stop_replication;
        ```

    4. With replication stopped, connect to the replica, and then run the `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` command to retrieve the current binary log file name from the **Relay_Master_Log_File** field and the log file position from the **Exec_Master_Log_Pos** field.
    5. Save these values to start replication from your Azure Database for MySQL server.
    6. To create a dump of the data from the AWS RDS for MySQL read replica, execute mysqldump by running the following command:

        ```
        $ mysqldump -h hostname -u username -p –single-transaction –databases dbnames –order-by-primary> dumpname.sql
        ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use mydumper for taking a parallelized dump of your data from your source AWS RDS for MySQL database. For more information, see [Migrating large database to Azure Database for MySQL using mydumper/myloader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-migrate-mydumper-myloader).

## Link source and replica servers to start Data-in replication

1. To restore the database using mysql native restore, run the following command:

    ```
    $ mysql -h <target_server> -u <targetuser> -p < dumpname.sql
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you’re instead using myloader, see [Migrating large database to Azure Database for MySQL using mydumper/myloader](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-migrate-mydumper-myloader).

2. Sign into the source AWS RDS for MySQL server, set up a replication user, and then grant the necessary privileges to this user.

    - If you’re using SSL, run the following commands:

        ```
        Mysql> CREATE USER ‘syncuser’@’%’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘userpassword’;
        Mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT on *.* to ‘syncuser’@'%' REQUIRE SSL; 
        Mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR syncuser@’%’;
        ```

    - If you’re not using SSL, run the following command:

        ```
        Mysql> CREATE USER ‘syncuser’@’%’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘userpassword’;
        Mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT on *.* to ‘syncuser’@'%'; 
        Mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR syncuser@’%’;
        ```

    All Data-in replication functions are done by stored procedures. For information about all procedures, see [Data-in replication stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/reference-stored-procedures#data-in-replication-stored-procedures). You can run these stored procedures in the MySQL shell or MySQL Workbench.

3. To link the AWS RDS for MySQL source server and the Azure Database for MySQL target server, sign into the target Azure Database for MySQL server and set the AWS RDS for MySQL server as the source server by running the following command:

    ```
    CALL mysql.az_replication_change_master('source_server','replication_user_name','replication_user_password',3306,’<master_bin_log_file>’,master_bin_log_position,'<master_ssl_ca>');
    ```

4. To start replication between the source AWS RDS for MySQL server and the target Azure Database for MySQL server, run the following command:

    ```
    Mysql> CALL mysql.az_replication_start;
    ```

5. To check the status of the replication, on the replica server, run the following command:

    ```
    Mysql> show slave status\G
    ```

    If the state of the `Slave_IO_Running` and `Slave_SQL_Running` parameters is **Yes**, then replication has started and is in a running state.

6. Check the value of the `Seconds_Behind_Master` parameter to determine how delayed the target server is.

    If the value is **0**, then the target has processed all updates from the source server. If the value is anything other than **0**, the target server is still processing updates.

## Ensure a successful cutover

To ensure a successful cutover, perform the following tasks:

1. Configure the appropriate logins and database level permissions in the target Azure Database for MySQL server.
2. Stop writes to the source AWS RDS for MySQL server.
3. Ensure that the target Azure Database for MySQL server has caught up with the source server and that the `Seconds_Behind_Master` value is **0** from `show slave status`.
4. Call the stored procedure `mysql.az_replication_stop` to stop the replication since all changes have been replicated to the target Azure Database for MySQL server.
5. Call `mysql.az_replication_remove_master` to remove the Data-in replication configuration.
6. Redirect clients and client applications to the target Azure Database for MySQL server.

At this point, the migration is complete, and your applications are connected to the server running Azure Database for MySQL.
