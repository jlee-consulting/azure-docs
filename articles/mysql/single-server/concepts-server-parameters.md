# Server parameters in Azure Database for MySQL

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-single-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-single-server.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-database-for-mysql-single-server-deprecation](../includes/azure-database-for-mysql-single-server-deprecation.md)]

This article provides considerations and guidelines for configuring server parameters in Azure Database for MySQL.

## What are server parameters? 

The MySQL engine provides many different server variables and parameters that you use to configure and tune engine behavior. Some parameters can be set dynamically during runtime, while others are static, and require a server restart in order to apply.

Azure Database for MySQL exposes the ability to change the value of various MySQL server parameters by using the [Azure portal](./how-to-server-parameters.md), the [Azure CLI](./how-to-configure-server-parameters-using-cli.md), and [PowerShell](./how-to-configure-server-parameters-using-powershell.md) to match your workload's needs.

## Configurable server parameters

The list of supported server parameters is constantly growing. In the Azure portal, use the server parameters tab to view the full list and configure server parameters values.

Refer to the following sections to learn more about the limits of several commonly updated server parameters. The limits are determined by the pricing tier and vCores of the server.

### Thread pools

MySQL traditionally assigns a thread for every client connection. As the number of concurrent users grows, there is a corresponding drop in performance. Many active threads can affect the performance significantly, due to increased context switching, thread contention, and bad locality for CPU caches.

*Thread pools*, a server-side feature and distinct from connection pooling, maximize performance by introducing a dynamic pool of worker threads. You use this feature to limit the number of active threads running on the server and minimize thread churn. This helps ensure that a burst of connections won't cause the server to run out of resources or memory. Thread pools are most efficient for short queries and CPU intensive workloads, such as OLTP workloads.

For more information, see [Introducing thread pools in Azure Database for MySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/introducing-thread-pools-in-azure-database-for-mysql-service/ba-p/1504173).

> [!NOTE]
> Thread pools aren't supported for MySQL 5.6. 

### Configure the thread pool

To enable a thread pool, update the `thread_handling` server parameter to `pool-of-threads`. By default, this parameter is set to `one-thread-per-connection`, which means MySQL creates a new thread for each new connection. This is a static parameter, and requires a server restart to apply.

You can also configure the maximum and minimum number of threads in the pool by setting the following server parameters: 

- `thread_pool_max_threads`: This value ensures that there won't be more than this number of threads in the pool.
- `thread_pool_min_threads`: This value sets the number of threads that will be reserved even after connections are closed.

To improve performance issues of short queries on the thread pool, you can enable *batch execution*. Instead of returning back to the thread pool immediately after running a query, threads will keep active for a short time to wait for the next query through this connection. The thread then runs the query rapidly and, when this is complete, the thread waits for the next one. This process continues until the overall time spent exceeds a threshold.

You determine the behavior of batch execution by using the following server parameters:  

-  `thread_pool_batch_wait_timeout`: This value specifies the time a thread waits for another query to process.
- `thread_pool_batch_max_time`: This value determines the maximum time a thread will repeat the cycle of query execution and waiting for the next query.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't turn on the thread pool in production until you've tested it. 

### log_bin_trust_function_creators

In Azure Database for MySQL, binary logs are always enabled (the `log_bin` parameter is set to `ON`). If you want to use triggers, you get error similar to the following: *You do not have the SUPER privilege and binary logging is enabled (you might want to use the less safe `log_bin_trust_function_creators` variable)*. 

The binary logging format is always **ROW**, and all connections to the server *always* use row-based binary logging. Row-based binary logging helps maintain security, and binary logging can't break, so you can safely set [`log_bin_trust_function_creators`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_bin_trust_function_creators) to `TRUE`.

### innodb_buffer_pool_size

Review the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_buffer_pool_size) to learn more about this parameter.

### innodb_file_per_table

MySQL stores the `InnoDB` table in different tablespaces, based on the configuration you provide during the table creation. The [system tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-system-tablespace.html) is the storage area for the `InnoDB` data dictionary. A [file-per-table tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-file-per-table-tablespaces.html) contains data and indexes for a single `InnoDB` table, and is stored in the file system in its own data file.

You control this behavior by using the `innodb_file_per_table` server parameter. Setting `innodb_file_per_table` to `OFF` causes `InnoDB` to create tables in the system tablespace. Otherwise, `InnoDB` creates tables in file-per-table tablespaces.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only update `innodb_file_per_table` in the general purpose and memory optimized pricing tiers on [general purpose storage v2](concepts-pricing-tiers.md#general-purpose-storage-v2-supports-up-to-16-tb-storage) and [general purpose storage v1](concepts-pricing-tiers.md#general-purpose-storage-v1-supports-up-to-4-tb).

Azure Database for MySQL supports 4 TB (at the largest) in a single data file on [general purpose storage v2](concepts-pricing-tiers.md#general-purpose-storage-v2-supports-up-to-16-tb-storage). If your database size is larger than 4 TB, you should create the table in the [innodb_file_per_table](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_file_per_table) tablespace. If you have a single table size that is larger than 4 TB, you should use the partition table.

### join_buffer_size

|Memory Optimized|32|10000|10|20000|

When the number of connections exceeds the limit, you might receive an error.

> [!TIP]
> To manage connections efficiently, it's a good idea to use a connection pooler, like ProxySQL. To learn about setting up ProxySQL, see the blog post [Load balance read replicas using ProxySQL in Azure Database for MySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/load-balance-read-replicas-using-proxysql-in-azure-database-for/ba-p/880042). Note that ProxySQL is an open source community tool. It's supported by Microsoft on a best-effort basis.

|Memory Optimized|32|16777216|16384|4294967295|

### query_cache_size

The query cache is turned off by default. To enable the query cache, configure the `query_cache_type` parameter. 

Review the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_query_cache_size) to learn more about this parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> The query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20 and has been removed in MySQL 8.0.

### lower_case_table_names

The `lower_case_table_name` parameter is set to 1 by default, and you can update this parameter in MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 5.7.

Review the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_lower_case_table_names) to learn more about this parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> In MySQL 8.0, `lower_case_table_name` is set to 1 by default, and you can't change it.

### innodb_strict_mode

If you receive an error similar to `Row size too large (> 8126)`, consider turning off the `innodb_strict_mode` parameter. You can't modify `innodb_strict_mode` globally at the server level. If row data size is larger than 8K, the data is truncated, without an error notification, leading to potential data loss. It's a good idea to modify the schema to fit the page size limit. 

You can set this parameter at a session level, by using `init_connect`. To set `innodb_strict_mode` at a session level, refer to [setting parameter not listed](./how-to-server-parameters.md#setting-parameters-not-listed).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a read replica server, setting `innodb_strict_mode` to `OFF` at the session-level on a source server will break the replication. We suggest keeping the parameter set to `ON` if you have read replicas.

### sort_buffer_size

### InnoDB buffer pool warmup

After you restart Azure Database for MySQL, the data pages that reside in the disk are loaded, as the tables are queried. This leads to increased latency and slower performance for the first run of the queries. For workloads that are sensitive to latency, you might find this slower performance unacceptable.

You can use `InnoDB` buffer pool warmup to shorten the warmup period. This process reloads disk pages that were in the buffer pool *before* the restart, rather than waiting for DML or SELECT operations to access corresponding rows. For more information, see [InnoDB buffer pool server parameters](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-preload-buffer-pool.html).

Note that improved performance comes at the expense of longer start-up time for the server. When you enable this parameter, the server startup and restart time is expected to increase, depending on the IOPS provisioned on the server. It's a good idea to test and monitor the restart time, to ensure that the start-up or restart performance is acceptable, because the server is unavailable during that time. Don't use this parameter when the IOPS provisioned is less than 1000 IOPS (in other words, when the storage provisioned is less than 335 GB).

To save the state of the buffer pool at server shutdown, set the server parameter `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown` to `ON`. Similarly, set the server parameter `innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup` to `ON` to restore the buffer pool state at server startup. You can control the impact on start-up or restart by lowering and fine-tuning the value of the server parameter `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct`. By default, this parameter is set to `25`.

> [!Note]
> `InnoDB` buffer pool warmup parameters are only supported in general purpose storage servers with up to 16 TB storage. For more information, see [Azure Database for MySQL storage options](./concepts-pricing-tiers.md#storage).

### time_zone

Upon initial deployment, a server running Azure Database for MySQL includes systems tables for time zone information, but these tables aren't populated. You can populate the tables by calling the `mysql.az_load_timezone` stored procedure from tools like the MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench. For information about how to call the stored procedures and set the global or session-level time zones, see [Working with the time zone parameter (Azure portal)](how-to-server-parameters.md#working-with-the-time-zone-parameter) or [Working with the time zone parameter (Azure CLI)](how-to-configure-server-parameters-using-cli.md#working-with-the-time-zone-parameter).

### binlog_expire_logs_seconds 

In Azure Database for MySQL, this parameter specifies the number of seconds the service waits before purging the binary log file.

The *binary log* contains events that describe database changes, such as table creation operations or changes to table data. It also contains events for statements that can potentially make changes. The binary log is used mainly for two purposes, replication and data recovery operations.

Usually, the binary logs are purged as soon as the handle is free from service, backup, or the replica set. In case of multiple replicas, the binary logs wait for the slowest replica to read the changes before being purged. If you want binary logs to persist longer, you can configure the parameter `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`. If you set `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` to `0`, which is the default value, it purges as soon as the handle to the binary log is freed. If you set `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` to greater than 0, then the binary log only purges after that period of time.

For Azure Database for MySQL, managed features like backup and read replica purging of binary files are handled internally. When you replicate the data out from the Azure Database for MySQL service, you must set this parameter in the primary to avoid purging binary logs before the replica reads from the changes from the primary. If you set the `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` to a higher value, then the binary logs won't get purged soon enough. This can lead to an increase in the storage billing. 

## Non-configurable server parameters

The following server parameters aren't configurable in the service:

|**Parameter**|**Fixed value**|
| :------------------------ | :-------- |
|`innodb_file_per_table` in the basic tier|OFF|
|`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`|1|
|`sync_binlog`|1|
|`innodb_log_file_size`|256 MB|
|`innodb_log_files_in_group`|2|

Other variables not listed here are set to the default MySQL values. Refer to the MySQL docs for versions [8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html), [5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html), and [5.6](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.html).
