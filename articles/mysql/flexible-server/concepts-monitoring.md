# Monitor Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-flexible-server.md)]

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server provides monitoring of servers through Azure Monitor. Monitoring data about your servers helps you troubleshoot and optimize for your workload.

In this article, you learn about the various metrics available and Server logs for your flexible server that give insight into the behavior of your server.

> [!NOTE]
> This article contains references to the term *slave*, a term that Microsoft no longer uses. When the term is removed from the software, we'll remove it from this article.

## Metrics

Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of the resources of your server at a particular time. Monitoring your server's resources helps you troubleshoot and optimize your workload by allowing you to monitor what matters the most to you. Monitoring the right metrics helps you keep the performance, reliability, and availability of your server and applications.

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server provides various metrics to understand how your workload is performing and based on this data, you can understand the impact on your server and application.

All Azure metrics have a one-minute frequency, and each metric provides 30 days of history. You can configure alerts on the metrics. For step-by-step guidance, see [How to set up alerts](./how-to-alert-on-metric.md). Other tasks include setting up automated actions, performing advanced analytics, and archiving history. For more information, see the [Azure Metrics Overview](../../azure-monitor/data-platform.md).

### Troubleshooting Metrics
Sometimes, you might run into issues with creating, customizing, or interpreting charts in Azure metrics explorer. 
The situation of a *Chart showing no data* could arise due to various factors. These might include the Microsoft Insights resource provider not being registered for your subscription, or you lacking adequate access rights to your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server. Other possibilities could be that your resource didn't generate metrics within the chosen time frame, or the selected time range exceeds 30 days.

Several reasons that follow can cause this behavior:

- *Microsoft.Insights resource provider isn’t registered*: Exploring metrics requires Microsoft.Insights resource provider registered in your subscription. Register your server manually by following steps described in [Azure resource providers and types](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).
- *Insufficient access rights to your resource*: Ensure that you have sufficient permissions for your Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server from which you’re exploring metrics. Your resource didn’t emit metrics during the selected time range: Change the time of the chart to a wider range. In Azure, [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) controls access to metrics. You must be a member of [monitoring reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#monitoring-reader), [monitoring contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#monitoring-contributor), or [contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) to explore metrics for any resource.
- *Your resource didn’t emit metrics during the selected time range*: This could be due to several reasons. One possibility is that your resource didn’t generate metrics within the chosen time frame. Change the time of the chart to a wider range to see if this resolves the issue. For more detailed information on troubleshooting this issue, refer to the [Azure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot.md#your-resource-didnt-emit-metrics-during-the-selected-time-range).
- *Time range greater than 30 days*: Verify that the difference between start- and end- dates in the time picker doesn’t exceed the 30-day interval. For more detailed information on troubleshooting metrics, refer to the [Azure Monitor metrics troubleshooting guide](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot.md).
- *Dashed Line Indication*: In Azure Monitor, the presence of a dashed line signifies a gap in data, or a "null value", between two points of known time grain data. This is a deliberate design that helps in the detection of missing data points. If your chart displays dashed lines, it indicates missing data and you can refer to the [documentation for further information.](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-troubleshoot.md#chart-shows-dashed-line)

> [!NOTE] 
> Metrics that are marked as deprecated are scheduled to be removed from azure portal. It's recommended to ignore these metrics for monitoring your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.

> [!NOTE]
> For [read replicas](./concepts-read-replicas.md) in Azure Database for MySQL flexible server, value of Slave_IO_Running/Replica_IO_Running from MySQL command "[SHOW SLAVE STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-administration-status.html)" or "[SHOW REPLICA STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-administration-status.html)" will be denoted as "NO" and should be ignored because Azure Database for MySQL flexible server's implementation of replicas does not rely on establishing a connection to communicate with the source server. For genuine status of I/O thread of your read replicas kindly refer to [Replica IO Status](#replication-metrics) from Metrics under Monitoring blade.

## Server logs

In Azure Database for MySQL flexible server, users can configure and download server logs to assist with troubleshooting efforts. With this feature enabled, an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance starts capturing events of the selected log type and writes them to a file. You can then use the Azure portal and Azure CLI to download the files to work with them.
The server logs feature is disabled by default. For information about how to enable server logs, see [How to enable and download server logs for Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.](./how-to-server-logs-portal.md)

Server logs support [slow query logs](./concepts-slow-query-logs.md) and [error logs](./concepts-error-logs.md) for enabling and downloading.
To perform a historical analysis of your data, in the Azure portal, on the Diagnostics settings pane for your server, add a diagnostic setting to send the logs to Log Analytics workspace, Azure Storage, or event hubs. For more information, see [Set up diagnostics](./tutorial-query-performance-insights.md#set-up-diagnostics).

**Server logs retention**

When logging is enabled for an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance, logs are available up to seven days from their creation. If the total size of the available logs exceeds 7 GB, then the oldest files are deleted until space is available.
The 7-GB storage limit for server logs is available free of cost and can't be extended.
Logs are rotated every 24 hours or 500 MB, whichever comes first.
