# Migrate from Azure Data Catalog to Microsoft Purview

Microsoft launched a unified data governance service to help manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. Microsoft Purview creates a map of your data landscape with automated data discovery, sensitive data classification, and end-to-end data lineage. Microsoft Purview data governance solutions enable data curators to manage and secure their data estate and empowers data consumers to find valuable, trustworthy data.
