# Attach or detach a compute gallery in Azure Lab Services

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If using a version of Azure Lab Services prior to the [August 2022 Update](lab-services-whats-new.md), see [Attach or detach a shared image gallery to a lab account in Azure Lab Services](how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery-1.md).

This article shows you how to attach or detach an Azure Compute Gallery to a lab plan.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lab plan administrators must manually [replicate images](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md) to other regions in the compute gallery. Replicate an Azure Compute Gallery image to the same region as the lab plan to be shown in the list of virtual machine images during lab creation.

Saving images to a compute gallery and replicating those images incurs additional cost. This cost is separate from the Azure Lab Services usage cost. For more information about Azure Compute Gallery pricing, see [Azure Compute Gallery â€“ Billing](../virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery.md#billing).

## Scenarios

Here are a couple of scenarios supported by attaching a compute gallery.

- A lab plan admin attaches a compute gallery to the lab plan. An image is uploaded to the compute gallery outside the context of a lab. The image is enabled on the lab plan by the lab plan admin. Then, lab creators can use that image from the compute gallery to create labs.
- A lab plan admin attaches a compute gallery to the lab plan. A lab creator (educator) saves the customized image of their lab to the compute gallery. Then, other lab creators can select this image from the compute gallery to create a template for their labs.

When you [save a template image of a lab](how-to-use-shared-image-gallery.md#save-an-image-to-a-compute-gallery) in Azure Lab Services, the image is uploaded to the compute gallery as a specialized image. [Specialized images](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md#generalized-and-specialized-images) keep machine-specific information and user profiles. You can still directly upload a generalized image to the gallery outside of Azure Lab Services.

A lab creator can create a template VM based on both generalized and specialized images in Azure Lab Services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While using an Azure Compute Gallery, Azure Lab Services supports only images that use less than 128 GB of disk space on their OS drive. Images with more than 128 GB of disk space or multiple disks won't be shown in the list of virtual machine images during lab creation.

## Create and attach a compute gallery

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your user account must have permission to create a new Azure Compute Gallery.

1. Open your lab plan in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Azure compute gallery** on the menu.
1. Select the **Create Azure compute gallery** button.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery/no-gallery-create-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create Azure compute gallery button.":::

1. In the **Create Azure compute gallery** window, enter a **name** for the gallery, and then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery/create-azure-compute-gallery-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create compute gallery window.":::

Azure Lab Services creates the compute gallery and attaches it to the lab plan. All labs created using this lab plan can now use images from the attached compute gallery.

In the bottom pane, you see images in the compute gallery. There are no images in this new gallery. When you upload images to the gallery, you see them on this page.

## Attach an existing compute gallery

The following procedure shows you how to attach an existing compute gallery to a lab plan.

1. Open your lab plan in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Azure compute gallery** on the menu.
1. Select the **Attach existing gallery** button.  

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery/no-gallery-attach-existing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Attach existing gallery button.":::

1. On the **Attach an existing compute gallery** page, select your compute gallery, and then select the **Select** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery/attach-existing-compute-gallery.png" alt-text="Azure compute gallery page for lab plan when gallery has been attached.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The **Azure Lab Services** app must be assigned the **Owner** role on the compute gallery to show in the list.

All labs created using this lab plan can now use images from the attached compute gallery.

## Enable and disable images

All images in the attached compute gallery are disabled by default. To enable selected images:

1. Check images you want to enable.
1. Select **Enable image**  button.
1. Select **Apply**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery/enable-attached-gallery-image.png" alt-text="Enable an imaged for an attached compute gallery.":::

To disable selected images:

1. Check images you want to disable.
1. Select **Disable image**  button.
1. Select **Apply**.

## Detach a compute gallery

To detach a compute gallery from your lab, select **Detach** on the toolbar. Confirm the detach operation.  

Only one Azure Compute Gallery can be attached to a lab. To attach another compute gallery, follow the below steps:

1. Select **Change gallery** on the toolbar.
1. Confirm the change operation.
1. On the **Attach an existing compute gallery** page, select your compute gallery, and then select the **Select** button.

## Next steps

To learn how to save a template image to the compute gallery or use an image from the compute gallery, see [How to use a compute gallery](how-to-use-shared-image-gallery.md).

To explore other options for bringing custom images to compute gallery outside of the context of a lab, see [Recommended approaches for creating custom images](approaches-for-custom-image-creation.md).
