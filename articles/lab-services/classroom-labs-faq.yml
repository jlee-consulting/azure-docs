title: Labs in Azure Lab Services — Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
summary: Get answers to some of the most common questions about labs in Azure Lab Services. 

sections:
  - name: Quotas
    questions:
      - question: |
          Is the quota per user or per week or per entire duration of the lab? 
        answer: |
          The quota you set for a lab is for each student for entire duration of the lab. And, the [scheduled running time of VMs](how-to-create-schedules.md) doesn't count against the quota allotted to a user. The quota is for the time outside of schedule hours that a student spends on VMs.  For more information on quotas, see [Set quotas for users](how-to-configure-student-usage.md#set-quotas-for-users).

  - name: Lab accounts
    questions:
      - question: |
          Why am I not able to create a lab because of unavailability of the address range? 
        answer: |
          Labs can create lab VMs within an IP address range you specify when creating your lab account in the Azure portal. When an address range is provided, each lab that's created after it's allotted 512 IP addresses for lab VMs. The address range for the lab account must be large enough to accommodate all the labs you intend to create under the lab account. 
          
          For example, if you have a block of /19 - 10.0.0.0/19, this address range accommodates 8192 IP addresses and 16 labs(8192/512 = 16 labs). In this case, lab creation fails on 17th lab creation.

  - name: Virtual machine images
    questions:
      - question: |
          As a lab creator, why can't I enable additional image options in the virtual machine images dropdown when creating a new lab?
        answer: |
          When an administrator adds you as a lab creator to a lab account, you're given the permissions to create labs. But, you don't have the permissions to edit any settings inside the lab account, including the list of enabled virtual machine images. To enable additional images, contact your lab account administrator to do it for you, or ask the administrator to add you as a Contributor role to the lab account. The Contributor role will give you the permissions to edit the virtual machine image list in the lab account.

      - question: |
          Can I attach additional disks to a virtual machine?
        answer: |
          No. it's not possible to attach additional disks to a VM in a lab. 

  - name: Users
    questions:
      - question: |
          How many users can be in a lab?
        answer: |
          You can add up to 400 users to a lab.


  - name: Linux
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I use Ubuntu 18.04 Server LTS and install either the GNOME or MATE graphical desktops?
        answer: |
          There is a [known networking conflict between GNOME\MATE](./how-to-enable-remote-desktop-linux.md) graphical desktops) and the Azure Linux VM Agent when using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  As a result, we suggest the following:
            - Instead of GNOME\MATE, consider using the XFCE graphical desktop which doesn't have this issue.  For example, the [Data Science VM image is configured by default to use XFCE](../machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md#x2go).
            - Instead of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, consider using Ubuntu 20.04 or 21.04 LTS which don't have this networking conflict with the agent when GNOME\MATE is installed.
            - Otherwise, to use 18.04 LTS and GNOME\MATE, you will need to apply a workaround to fix the networking conflict with the agent.
          See our [ReadMe and scripts](https://aka.ms/azlabs/scripts/LinuxDesktop-GnomeMate) that set up Ubuntu Server 18.04\20.04\21.04 with GNOME\MATE.  When you use these scripts to set up 18.04 with GNOME\MATE, they will apply the workaround for the networking conflict.
