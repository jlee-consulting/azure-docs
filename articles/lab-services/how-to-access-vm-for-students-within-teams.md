# Access a VM (student view) in Azure Lab from Teams

When a lab is created within Teams, users can view and access all the VMs provisioned by the team owner. When the lab is published and VMs are created, users are automatically registered to the lab. A VM will be assigned when they first sign into Azure Lab Services. Users can view and access the VMs assigned to them by selecting the tab containing **Azure Lab Services** app.

Students see a message if the lab hasn't been published yet. Lab is also seen as unable if sync is yet to be triggered after they're added to the team.
