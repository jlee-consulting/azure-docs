# Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop Protocol on a Chromebook

This section shows how a student can connect to a lab VM from a Chromebook by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Install Microsoft Remote Desktop on a Chromebook

1. Open the App Store on your Chromebook, and search for **Microsoft Remote Desktop**.

1. Install the latest version of **Remote Desktop** by Microsoft Corporation.

## Access the VM from your Chromebook using RDP

1. On the tile for your VM, ensure the [VM is running](how-to-use-lab.md#start-or-stop-the-vm) and select the **Connect** icon.

1. If youâ€™re connecting *to a Linux VM*, you'll see two options to connect to the VM: SSH and RDP.  Select the **Connect via RDP** option.  If you're connecting *to a Windows VM*, you don't need to choose an connection option.  The RDP file will automatically start downloading.

1. Open the **RDP** file that's downloaded on your computer with **Microsoft Remote Desktop** installed. It should start connecting to the VM.

1. Once the connection is complete you'll see the desktop of your lab VM.
