> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article applies to early versions of Azure Lab Services prior to the [August 2022 Update](../lab-services-whats-new.md). Newer updates to the service build upon [lab plans]( ../classroom-labs-concepts.md#lab-plans) instead of lab accounts. We recommend you use lab plans for all new labs.
