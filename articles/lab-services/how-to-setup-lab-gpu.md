# Set up a lab with GPU virtual machines

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

This article shows you how to do the following tasks:

- Choose between *visualization* and *compute* graphics processing units (GPUs).
- Ensure that the appropriate GPU drivers are installed.

## Choose between visualization and compute GPU sizes

On the first page of the lab creation wizard, in the **Virtual machine size** drop-down list, you select the size of the VMs that are needed for your class.  

![Screenshot of the "New lab" pane for selecting a VM size](./media/how-to-setup-gpu/lab-gpu-selection.png)

In this process, you have the option of selecting either **Visualization** or **Compute** GPUs.  It's important to choose the type of GPU that's based on the software that your students will use.  

As described in the following table, the *compute* GPU size is intended for compute-intensive applications.  For example, the [Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing class type](./class-type-deep-learning-natural-language-processing.md) uses the **Small GPU (Compute)** size.  The compute GPU is suitable for this type of class, because students use deep learning frameworks and tools that are provided by the [Data Science Virtual Machine image](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.ubuntu-1804) to train deep learning models with large sets of data.

| Size | vCPUs | RAM | Description |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ----------- |
| Small GPU (Compute) | 6  vCPUs | 112 GB RAM  | [Standard_NC6s_v3](../virtual-machines/ncv3-series.md). This size supports both Windows and Linux and is best suited for compute-intensive applications such as artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. |

The *visualization* GPU sizes are intended for graphics-intensive applications.  For example, the [SOLIDWORKS engineering class type](./class-type-solidworks.md) shows using the **Small GPU (Visualization)** size.  The visualization GPU is suitable for this type of class, because students interact with the SOLIDWORKS 3D computer-aided design (CAD) environment for modeling and visualizing solid objects.

| Size | vCPUs | RAM | Description |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ----------- |
| Small GPU (Visualization) | 8 vCPUs | 28 GB RAM  | [Standard_NV8as_v4](../virtual-machines/nvv4-series.md).  This size is best suited for remote visualization, streaming, gaming, and encoding that use frameworks such as OpenGL and DirectX. Currently, this size supports Windows only. |
| Medium GPU (Visualization) | 12 vCPUs  | 112 GB RAM  | [Standard_NV12s_v3](../virtual-machines/nvv3-series.md).  This size supports both Windows and Linux.  It's best suited for remote visualization, streaming, gaming, and encoding that use frameworks such as OpenGL and DirectX. |

> [!NOTE]
> You may not see some of these VM sizes in the list when creating a lab. This list is populated based on the capacity assigned to your Microsoft-managed Azure subscription.  For more information about capacity, see [Capacity limits in Azure Lab Services](../lab-services/capacity-limits.md).  For availability of VM sizes, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/?products=virtual-machines).

## Ensure that the appropriate GPU drivers are installed

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of your lab VMs, ensure that the appropriate GPU drivers are installed.  In the lab creation wizard, when you select a GPU VM size, you can select the **Install GPU drivers** option.  This option is enabled by default.

![Screenshot of the "New lab" showing the "Install GPU drivers" option](./media/how-to-setup-gpu/lab-gpu-drivers.png)

Selecting **Install GPU drivers** ensures that recently released drivers are installed for the type of GPU and image that you selected.

- When you select the Small GPU *(Compute)* size, your lab VMs are powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/) GPU.  In this case, recent Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) drivers are installed, which enables high-performance computing.
- When you select the Small GPU *(Visualization)* size, your lab VMs are powered by the [AMD Raedon Instinct MI25 Accelerator GPU](https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/instinct-mi25).  In this case, recent AMD GPU drivers are installed, which enables the use of graphics-intensive applications.
- When you select the Medium GPU *(Visualization)* size, your lab VMs are powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla M60](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/188417-Tesla-M60-DS-A4-fnl-Web.pdf) GPU and [GRID technology](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/solutions/resources/documents1/NVIDIA_GRID_vPC_Solution_Overview.pdf).  In this case, recent GRID drivers are installed, which enables the use of graphics-intensive applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Install GPU drivers** option only installs the drivers when they aren't present on your lab's image.  For example, NVIDIA GPU drivers are already installed on the Azure marketplace's [Data Science image](../machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview.md#whats-included-on-the-dsvm).  If you create a Small GPU (Compute) lab using the Data Science image and choose to **Install GPU drivers**, the drivers won't be updated to a more recent version.  To update the drivers, you will need to manually install them as explained in the next section.  

### Install the drivers manually

You might need to install a different version of the drivers than the version that Azure Lab Services installs for you.  This section shows how to manually install the appropriate drivers.

#### Install the Small GPU (Compute) drivers

To manually install drivers for the Small GPU *(Compute)* size, follow these steps:

1. In the lab creation wizard, when you're [creating your lab](./how-to-manage-labs.md), disable the **Install GPU drivers** setting.

1. After your lab is created, connect to the template VM to install the appropriate drivers. Read [NVIDIA Tesla (CUDA) drivers](../virtual-machines/windows/n-series-driver-setup.md#nvidia-tesla-cuda-drivers) for more information about specific driver versions that are recommended depending on the Windows OS version being used.  Otherwise, follow the below steps to install the latest NVIDIA drivers:

### Validate the installed drivers

This section describes how to validate that your GPU drivers are properly installed.

#### Small GPU (Visualization) Windows images

To verify driver installation for **Small GPU (Visualization)** size, see [validate the AMD GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/n-series-driver-setup.md#verify-driver-installation).

#### Small GPU (Compute) and Medium GPU (Visualization) Windows images

To verify driver installation for **Small GPU (Visualization)** size, see [validate the NVIDIA GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/n-series-driver-setup.md#verify-driver-installation).

You can also validate the NVIDIA control panel settings, which only apply to the **Medium GPU (visualization)** VM size:

1. View and adjust your GPU settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel. To do so, in **Windows Control Panel**, select **Hardware**, and then select **NVIDIA Control Panel**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-setup-gpu/control-panel-nvidia-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Windows Control Panel showing the NVIDIA Control Panel link.":::

1. View your GPU performance by using **Task Manager**.  To do so, select the **Performance** tab, and then select the **GPU** option.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-setup-gpu/task-manager-gpu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Task Manager GPU Performance tab.":::

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The NVIDIA Control Panel settings can be accessed only for the Medium GPU (visualization) VM size.  If you attempt to open the NVIDIA Control Panel for a compute GPU, you'll get the error: "NVIDIA Display settings are not available.  You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU."  Similarly, the GPU performance information in Task Manager is provided only for visualization GPUs.

Depending on your scenario, you may also need to do more validation to ensure the GPU is properly configured.  Read the class type about [Python and Jupyter Notebooks](class-type-jupyter-notebook.md#template-machine-configuration) that explains an example where specific versions of drivers are needed.

#### Small GPU (Compute) and Medium GPU (Visualization) Linux images

To verify driver installation for Linux images, see [verify driver installation for NVIDIA GPU drivers on N-series VMs running Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/n-series-driver-setup.md#verify-driver-installation).
