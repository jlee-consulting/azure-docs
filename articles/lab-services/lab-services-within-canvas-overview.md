# Overview of Lab Services within Canvas
 
[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

Azure Lab Services now provides an integrated experience for using labs with the Canvas. [Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) is a cloud-based learning management system that provides one place for course content, quizzes, and grades for both educators and students. Educators can create labs from within Canvas and students will see their lab VMs alongside their other material for a course.

## Benefits

Integration with Canvas LMS includes the following key capabilities:

- Labs are created and managed inside a course in Canvas.
- Each lab automatically pulls and updates the list of students based on the latest course roster.
- Virtual machines are added and deleted automatically based on changes to the course roster.
- Students access their labs directly inside a course in Canvas.
