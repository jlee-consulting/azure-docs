# Create and manage Lab Services schedules within Canvas

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

Schedules allow you to configure a lab such that VMs in the lab automatically start and shut down at a specified time. You can define a one-time schedule or a recurring schedule. 

Here is how schedules affect lab VM:

- Template virtual machine is not included in schedules.
- Only assigned virtual machines are started. If a machine is not claimed by a student, the VM will not start when a schedule runs.
- All virtual machines (whether claimed by a user or not) are stopped based on the schedule.

The scheduled running time of VMs does not count against the [quota](classroom-labs-concepts.md#quota) given to a user. The quota is for the time outside of schedule hours that a student spends on VMs.

Educators can create, edit, and delete lab schedules within Canvas as in the Azure Lab Services portal. For more information on scheduling, see [Creating and managing schedules](how-to-create-schedules.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Schedules will apply at the course level.  If you have many sections of a course, consider using [automatic shutdown policies](how-to-configure-auto-shutdown-lab-plans.md) and/or [quotas hours](how-to-configure-student-usage.md#set-quotas-for-users).
