[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/lab-services-new-update-focused-article.md)]

This article shows how to delete a lab from the **Azure Lab Services** app.

## Prerequisites

* [Create a Lab Plan](tutorial-setup-lab-plan.md#create-a-lab-plan) in the Azure portal.
* [Get started and create a Lab Services lab within Canvas](how-to-get-started-create-lab-within-canvas.md).

## Delete labs

A lab created within Canvas can be deleted in the [Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com) by deleting the lab directly, as described in [Manage labs in Azure Lab Services](how-to-manage-labs.md).
