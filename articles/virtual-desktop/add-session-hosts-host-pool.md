# Add session hosts to a host pool

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Stack HCI is currently in preview for Azure Government and Azure China. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Once you've created a host pool, workspace, and an application group, you need to add session hosts to the host pool for your users to connect to. You may also need to add more session hosts for extra capacity.

You can create new virtual machines (VMs) to use as session hosts and add them to a host pool natively using the Azure Virtual Desktop service in the Azure portal. Alternatively you can also create VMs outside of the Azure Virtual Desktop service, such as with an automated pipeline, then add them as session hosts to a host pool. When using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell you'll need to create the VMs outside of Azure Virtual Desktop, then add them as session hosts to a host pool separately.

For Azure Stack HCI, you can also create new VMs to use as session hosts and add them to a host pool natively using the Azure Virtual Desktop service in the Azure portal. Alternatively, if you want to create the VMs outside of the Azure Virtual Desktop service, see [Create Arc virtual machines on Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-arc-virtual-machines), then add them as session hosts to a host pool separately.

This article shows you how to generate a registration key using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, then how to add session hosts to a host pool using the Azure Virtual Desktop service or add them to a host pool separately.

## Prerequisites

Review the [Prerequisites for Azure Virtual Desktop](prerequisites.md) for a general idea of what's required, such as operating systems, virtual networks, and identity providers. In addition, you'll need:

- An existing host pool. Each host pool must only contain session hosts on Azure or on Azure Stack HCI. You can't mix session hosts on Azure and on Azure Stack HCI in the same host pool.

- If you have existing session hosts in the host pool, make a note of the virtual machine size, the image, and name prefix that was used. All session hosts in a host pool should be the same configuration, including the same identity provider. For example, a host pool shouldn't contain some session hosts joined to Microsoft Entra ID and some session hosts joined to an Active Directory domain.

- The Azure account you use must have the following built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles as a minimum on the resource group:

   | Action | RBAC role(s) |
   |--|--|
   | Generate a host pool registration key | [Desktop Virtualization Host Pool Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-host-pool-contributor) |
   | Create and add session hosts using the Azure portal (Azure) | [Desktop Virtualization Host Pool Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-host-pool-contributor)<br />[Virtual Machine Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) |
   | Create and add session hosts using the Azure portal (Azure Stack HCI) | [Desktop Virtualization Host Pool Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-host-pool-contributor)<br />[Azure Stack HCI VM Contributor](/azure-stack/hci/manage/assign-vm-rbac-roles) |

   Alternatively you can assign the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) RBAC role.

- Don't disable [Windows Remote Management](/windows/win32/winrm/about-windows-remote-management) (WinRM) when creating and adding session hosts using the Azure portal, as it's required by [PowerShell DSC](/powershell/dsc/overview).

- To add session hosts on Azure Stack HCI, you'll also need:

   - An [Azure Stack HCI cluster registered with Azure](/azure-stack/hci/deploy/register-with-azure). Your Azure Stack HCI clusters need to be running a minimum of version 23H2. For more information, see [Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 deployment overview](/azure-stack/hci/deploy/deployment-introduction). [Azure Arc virtual machine (VM) management](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview) is installed automatically.

   - A stable connection to Azure from your on-premises network.

   - At least one Windows OS image available on the cluster. For more information, see how to [create VM images using Azure Marketplace images](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-azure-marketplace), [use images in Azure Storage account](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-storage-account), and [use images in local share](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-local-share).

   - If you create VMs on Azure Stack HCI outside of the Azure Virtual Desktop service, such as with an automated pipeline, then add them as session hosts to a host pool, you need to install the [Azure Connected Machine agent](../azure-arc/servers/agent-overview.md) on the virtual machines so they can communicate with [Azure Instance Metadata Service](../virtual-machines/instance-metadata-service.md), which is a [required endpoint for Azure Virtual Desktop](../virtual-desktop/required-fqdn-endpoint.md).

   - A logical network that you created on your Azure Stack HCI cluster. DHCP logical networks or static logical networks with automatic IP allocation are supported. For more information, see [Create logical networks for Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-logical-networks).

- If you want to use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell locally, see [Use Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell with Azure Virtual Desktop](cli-powershell.md) to make sure you have the [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/desktopvirtualization) Azure CLI extension or the [Az.DesktopVirtualization](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization) PowerShell module installed. Alternatively, use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to create Microsoft Entra joined session hosts, we only support this using the Azure portal with the Azure Virtual Desktop service.

## Generate a registration key

When you add session hosts to a host pool, first you'll need to generate a registration key. A registration key needs to be generated per host pool and it authorizes session hosts to join that host pool. It's only valid for the duration you specify. If an existing registration key has expired, you can also use these steps to generate a new key.

To generate a registration key, select the relevant tab for your scenario and follow the steps.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

Here's how to generate a registration key using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, type *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select **Host pools**, then select the name of the host pool you want to generate a registration key for.

1. On the host pool overview, select **Registration key**.

1. Select **Generate new key**, then enter an expiration date and time and select **OK**. The registration key will be created.

1. Select **Download** to download a text file containing the registration key, or copy the registration key to your clipboard to use later. You can also retrieve the registration key later by returning to the host pool overview.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Here's how to generate a registration key using the [Az.DesktopVirtualization](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization) PowerShell module.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the following examples, you'll need to change the `<placeholder>` values for your own.

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-powershell](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-powershell.md)]
2. Use the `New-AzWvdRegistrationInfo` cmdlet with the following example to generate a registration key that is valid for 24 hours.

   ```azurepowershell
   $parameters = @{
       HostPoolName = '<HostPoolName>'
       ResourceGroupName = '<ResourceGroupName>'
       ExpirationTime = $((Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().AddHours(24).ToString('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ'))
   }
   
   New-AzWvdRegistrationInfo @parameters
   ```

3. Get the registration key and copy it to your clipboard to use later. You can also retrieve the registration key later by running this command again anytime while the registration key is valid.

   ```azurepowershell
   $parameters = @{
       HostPoolName = '<HostPoolName>'
       ResourceGroupName = '<ResourceGroupName>'
   }
   
   (Get-AzWvdHostPoolRegistrationToken @parameters).Token
   ```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Here's how to generate a registration key using the [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/desktopvirtualization) extension for Azure CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the following examples, you'll need to change the `<placeholder>` values for your own.

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-cli](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-cli.md)]
2. Use the `az desktopvirtualization workspace update` command with the following example to generate a registration key that is valid for 24 hours.

   ```azurecli
   az desktopvirtualization hostpool update \
       --name <Name> \
       --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \
       --registration-info expiration-time=$(date -d '+24 hours' --iso-8601=ns) registration-token-operation="Update"
   ```

3. Get the registration key and copy it to your clipboard to use later. You can also retrieve the registration key later by running this command again anytime while the registration key is valid.

   ```azurecli
   az desktopvirtualization hostpool retrieve-registration-token \
       --name <Name> \
       --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \
       --query token --output tsv
   ```

## Create and register session hosts with the Azure Virtual Desktop service

You can create session hosts and register them to a host pool in a single end-to-end process with the Azure Virtual Desktop service using the Azure portal or an ARM template. You can find some example ARM templates in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/ARM-wvd-templates).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to create virtual machines using an alternative method outside of Azure Virtual Desktop, such as an automated pipeline, you'll need to register them separately as session hosts to a host pool. Skip to the section [Register session hosts to a host pool](#register-session-hosts-to-a-host-pool).

Here's how to create session hosts and register them to a host pool using the Azure Virtual Desktop service in the Azure portal. Make sure you're generated a registration key first.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search bar, enter *Azure Virtual Desktop* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select **Host pools**, then select the name of the host pool you want to add session hosts to.

1. On the host pool overview, select **Session hosts**, then select **+ Add**.

1. The **Basics** tab will be greyed out because you're using the existing host pool. Select **Next: Virtual Machines**.

1. On the **Virtual machines** tab, expand one of the following sections and complete the information, depending on whether you want to create session hosts on Azure or Azure Stack HCI. For guidance on sizing session host virtual machines, see [Session host virtual machine sizing guidelines](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/virtual-machine-recs).<br /><br />

> Once you've added session hosts with the Azure Virtual Desktop service, skip to the section [Post deployment](#post-deployment) for some extra configuration you may need to do.

## Register session hosts to a host pool

If you created virtual machines using an alternative method outside of Azure Virtual Desktop, such as an automated pipeline, you'll need to register them separately as session hosts to a host pool. To register session hosts to a host pool, you need to install the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent and the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent Bootloader on each virtual machine and use the registration key you generated. You can register session hosts to a host pool using the agent installers' graphical user interface (GUI) or using `msiexec` from a command line. Once complete, four applications will be listed as installed applications:

- Remote Desktop Agent Boot Loader.
- Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent.
- Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent.
- Remote Desktop Services SxS Network Stack.

Select the relevant tab for your scenario and follow the steps.

# [GUI](#tab/gui)

1. Make sure the virtual machines you want to use as session hosts are joined to Microsoft Entra ID or an Active Directory domain (AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services).

1. If your virtual machines are running a Windows Server OS, you'll need to install the *Remote Desktop Session Host* role, then restart the virtual machine. For more information, see [Install roles, role services, and features by using the add Roles and Features Wizard](/windows-server/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features#install-roles-role-services-and-features-by-using-the-add-roles-and-features-wizard).

1. Sign in to your virtual machine as an administrator.

1. Download the Agent and the Agent Bootloader installation files using the following links You may need to unblock them; right-click each file and select **Properties**, then select **Unblock**, and finally select **OK**.

   - [Azure Virtual Desktop Agent](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrmXv)
   - [Azure Virtual Desktop Agent Bootloader](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrxrH)

   > [!TIP]
   > The Azure Virtual Desktop Agent download link is for the latest production version in [non-validation environments](terminology.md#validation-environment). This download link is updated once the automatic production rollout is complete, so you might see a delay between a production version being released and the download link being updated. Once the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent is installed, it's updated automatically. For more information about the rollout of new versions of the agent, see [What's new in the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent](whats-new-agent.md#latest-available-versions).

1. Run the `Microsoft.RDInfra.RDAgent.Installer-x64-<version>.msi` file to install the Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent.

1. Follow the prompts and when the installer prompts for the registration token, paste it into the text box, which will appear on a single line. Select **Next**, then complete the installation.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-session-hosts-host-pool/agent-install-token.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to paste the registration token" lightbox="media/add-session-hosts-host-pool/agent-install-token.png":::

1. Run the `Microsoft.RDInfra.RDAgentBootLoader.Installer-x64.msi` file to install the remaining components.

1. Follow the prompts and complete the installation.

1. After a short time, the virtual machines should now be listed as session hosts in the host pool. The status of the session hosts may initially show as **Unavailable** and if there is a newer agent version available, it will upgrade automatically.

1. Once the status of the session hosts is **Available**, restart the virtual machines.

# [Command line](#tab/cmd)

Using `msiexec` enables you to install the agent and boot loader from the command line using automated deployment tools, such as Intune or Configuration Manager from Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the following examples, you'll need to change the `<placeholder>` values for your own.

1. Make sure the virtual machines you want to use as session hosts are joined to Microsoft Entra ID or an Active Directory domain (AD DS or Microsoft Entra Domain Services).

1. If your virtual machines are running a Windows Server OS, you'll need to install the *Remote Desktop Session Host* role by running the following command as an administrator, which will also restart the virtual machines:

   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature -Name RDS-RD-Server -Restart
   ```

1. Download the Agent and the Agent Bootloader installation files and unblock them by running the following commands. The files will be downloaded to the current working directory.

   ```powershell
   $uris = @(
       "https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrmXv"
       "https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrxrH"
   )

   $installers = @()
   foreach ($uri in $uris) {
       $download = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseBasicParsing

       $fileName = ($download.Headers.'Content-Disposition').Split('=')[1].Replace('"','')
       $output = [System.IO.FileStream]::new("$pwd\$fileName", [System.IO.FileMode]::Create)
       $output.write($download.Content, 0, $download.RawContentLength)
       $output.close()
       $installers += $output.Name
   }

   foreach ($installer in $installers) {
       Unblock-File -Path "$installer"
   }
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > This is the latest downloadable version of the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent in [non-validation environments](terminology.md#validation-environment). For more information about the rollout of new versions of the agent, see [What's new in the Azure Virtual Desktop Agent](whats-new-agent.md#latest-available-versions).

1. To install the Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent, run the following command as an administrator:

   ```powershell
   msiexec /i Microsoft.RDInfra.RDAgent.Installer-x64-<version>.msi /quiet REGISTRATIONTOKEN=<RegistrationToken>
   ```

1. To install the remaining components, run the following command as an administrator:

   ```powershell
   msiexec /i Microsoft.RDInfra.RDAgentBootLoader.Installer-x64.msi /quiet
   ```

1. After a short time, the virtual machines should now be listed as session hosts in the host pool. The status of the session hosts may initially show as **Unavailable** and if there is a newer agent version available, it will upgrade automatically.

1. Once the status of the session hosts is **Available**, restart the virtual machines.

## Post deployment

After you've added session hosts to your host pool, there's some extra configuration you may need to do, which is covered in the following sections.

[!INCLUDE [include-session-hosts-post-deployment](includes/include-session-hosts-post-deployment.md)]

## Next steps

Now that you've expanded your existing host pool, you can sign in to an Azure Virtual Desktop client to test them as part of a user session. You can connect to a session with any of the following clients:

- [Connect with the Windows Desktop client](./users/connect-windows.md)
- [Connect with the web client](./users/connect-web.md)
- [Connect with the Android client](./users/connect-android-chrome-os.md)
- [Connect with the macOS client](./users/connect-macos.md)
- [Connect with the iOS client](./users/connect-ios-ipados.md)
