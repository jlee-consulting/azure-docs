## Provide feedback

Visit the [Azure Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop/bd-p/AzureVirtualDesktopForum) to discuss the Azure Virtual Desktop service with the product team and active community members.

## All clients

### Your account is configured to prevent you from using this device

If you come across an error saying **Your account is configured to prevent you from using this device. For more information, contact your system administrator**, ensure the user account was given the [Virtual Machine User Login role](../active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows.md#azure-role-not-assigned) on the VMs. 

## Windows Desktop client

### The logon attempt failed

If you come across an error saying **The logon attempt failed** on the Windows Security credential prompt, verify the following:

- You are on a device that is Azure AD-joined or hybrid Azure AD-joined to the same Azure AD tenant as the session host OR
- You are on a device running Windows 10 2004 or later that is Azure AD registered to the same Azure AD tenant as the session host
- The [PKU2U protocol is enabled](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-allow-pku2u-authentication-requests-to-this-computer-to-use-online-identities) on both the local PC and the session host
- [Per-user MFA is disabled](deploy-azure-ad-joined-vm.md#enabling-mfa-for-azure-ad-joined-vms) for the user account as it's not supported for Azure AD-joined VMs.

### The sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed

If you come across an error saying **The sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed. Try a different sign-in method or contact your system administrator**, you have Conditional Access policies restricting access. Follow the instructions in [Enable multifactor authentication](deploy-azure-ad-joined-vm.md#enabling-mfa-for-azure-ad-joined-vms) to enable multifactor authentication for your Azure AD-joined VMs.

## Web client

### Sign in failed. Please check your username and password and try again

If you come across an error saying **Oops, we couldn't connect to NAME. Sign in failed. Please check your username and password and try again.** when using the web client, ensure that you [enabled connections from other clients](deploy-azure-ad-joined-vm.md#connect-using-the-other-clients).

### We couldn't connect to the remote PC because of a security error

If you come across an error saying **Oops, we couldn't connect to NAME. We couldn't connect to the remote PC because of a security error. If this keeps happening, ask your admin or tech support for help.**, you have Conditional Access policies restricting access. Follow the instructions in [Enable multifactor authentication](deploy-azure-ad-joined-vm.md#enabling-mfa-for-azure-ad-joined-vms) to enable multifactor authentication for your Azure AD-joined VMs.

## Android client

### Error code 2607 - We couldn't connect to the remote PC because your credentials did not work

If you come across an error saying **We couldn't connect to the remote PC because your credentials did not work. The remote machine is AADJ joined.** with error code 2607 when using the Android client, ensure that you [enabled connections from other clients](deploy-azure-ad-joined-vm.md#connect-using-the-other-clients).
