# Use the administrative template for Azure Virtual Desktop

We've created an administrative template for Azure Virtual Desktop to configure some features of Azure Virtual Desktop. You can use the template with:

- Intune, which enables you to centrally configure session hosts that are enrolled in Intune and joined to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined.

- Group Policy with Active Directory (AD), which enables you to centrally configure session hosts that are joined to an AD domain.

- Group Policy locally on each session host, but we don't recommend this to manage session hosts at scale.

You can configure the following features with the administrative template:

- [Graphics related data logging](connection-latency.md#connection-graphics-data-preview)
- [RDP Shortpath for managed networks](rdp-shortpath.md?tabs=managed-networks)
- [Screen capture protection](screen-capture-protection.md)
- [Watermarking](watermarking.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure the template settings, you need to meet the following prerequisites. Select a tab for your scenario.

# [Intune](#tab/intune)

For Intune device configuration profile, you need the following permission:

- Assigned the [**Policy and Profile manager**](/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control-reference#policy-and-profile-manager) built-in role-based access control (RBAC) role.

# [Group Policy (AD)](#tab/group-policy-domain)

For Group Policy in an Active Directory (AD) domain, you need the following permission:

- A member of the **Domain Admins** security group.

# [Local Group Policy](#tab/local-group-policy)

For local Group Policy on a session host, you need the following permission:

- A member of the local **Administrators** security group on each session host.

## Configure the administrative template

To configure the administrative template, select a tab for your scenario and follow these steps.

# [Intune](#tab/intune)

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).

1. [Create or edit a configuration profile](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-windows) for **Windows 10 and later** devices, with the **Settings catalog** profile type.

1. Once you've configured settings, apply the configuration profile to your session hosts, then restart your session hosts for the settings to take effect.

# [Group Policy (AD)](#tab/group-policy-domain)

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** and create or edit a policy that targets your session hosts.
