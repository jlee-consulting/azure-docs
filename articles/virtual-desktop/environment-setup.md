# Azure Virtual Desktop environment

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Azure Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Azure Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/environment-setup-2019.md).

Azure Virtual Desktop is a service that gives users easy and secure access to their virtualized desktops and RemoteApps. This topic will tell you a bit more about the general structure of the Azure Virtual Desktop environment.

## Host pools

A host pool is a collection of Azure virtual machines that register to Azure Virtual Desktop as session hosts when you run the Azure Virtual Desktop agent. All session host virtual machines in a host pool should be sourced from the same image for a consistent user experience.

A host pool can be one of two types:

- Personal, where each session host is assigned to individual users.
- Pooled, where session hosts can accept connections from any user authorized to an app group within the host pool.

You can set additional properties on the host pool to change its load-balancing behavior, how many sessions each session host can take, and what the user can do to session hosts in the host pool while signed in to their Azure Virtual Desktop sessions. You control the resources published to users through app groups.

## App groups

An app group is a logical grouping of applications installed on session hosts in the host pool.

An app group can be one of two types: 

- RemoteApp, where users access the RemoteApps you individually select and publish to the app group 
- Desktop, where users access the full desktop.
 
Each host pool has a preferred app group type that dictates whether users see RemoteApp or Desktop apps in their feed if both resources have been published to the same user. By default, Azure Virtual Desktop automatically creates a Desktop app group named "Desktop Application Group" whenever you create a host pool and sets the host pool's preferred app group type to **Desktop**. You can remove the Desktop app group at any time. If you want your users to only see RemoteApps in their feed, you should set the **Preferred App Group Type** value to **RemoteApp**. You can't create another Desktop app group in the host pool while a Desktop app group exists.

To publish resources to users, you must assign them to app groups. When assigning users to app groups, consider the following things:

- We don't support assigning both the RemoteApp and desktop app groups in a single host pool to the same user. Doing so will cause a single user to have two user sessions in a single host pool. Users aren't supposed to have two active user sessions at the same time, as this can cause the following things to happen:
    - The session hosts become overloaded
    - Users get stuck when trying to login
    - Connections won't work
    - The screen turns black
    - The application crashes
    - Other negative effects on end-user experience and session performance
- A user can be assigned to multiple app groups within the same host pool, and their feed will be an accumulation of both app groups.
- Personal host pools only allow and support RemoteApp app groups.

>[!NOTE]
>If your host pool’s Preferred App Group Type is set to **Undefined**, that means that you haven’t set the value yet. You must finish configuring your host pool by setting its Preferred App Group Type before you start using it to prevent app incompatibility and session host overload issues.

## Workspaces

A workspace is a logical grouping of application groups in Azure Virtual Desktop. Each Azure Virtual Desktop application group must be associated with a workspace for users to see the remote apps and desktops published to them.

## End users

After you've assigned users to their app groups, they can connect to an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment with any of the Azure Virtual Desktop clients.

## User sessions

In this section, we'll go over each of the three types of user sessions that end users can have.

### Active user session

A user session is considered "active" when a user signs in and connects to their remote app or desktop resource.

### Disconnected user session

A disconnected user session is an inactive session that the user hasn't signed out of yet. When a user closes the remote session window without signing out, the session becomes disconnected. When a user reconnects to their remote resources, they'll be redirected to their disconnected session on the session host they were working on. At this point, the disconnected session becomes an active session again.

### Pending user session

A pending user session is a placeholder session that reserves a spot on the load-balanced virtual machine for the user. Because the sign-in process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to five minutes depending on the user profile, this placeholder session ensures that the user won't be kicked out of their session if another user completes their sign-in process first.
