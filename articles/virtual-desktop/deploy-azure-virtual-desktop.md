# Deploy Azure Virtual Desktop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Stack HCI is currently in preview for Azure Government and Azure China. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article shows you how to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure or Azure Stack HCI by using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. To deploy Azure Virtual Desktop you:
- Create a host pool.
- Create a workspace.
- Create an application group.
- Create session host virtual machines.
- Enable diagnostics settings (*optional*).
- Assign users or groups to the application group for users to get access to desktops and applications.

You can do all these tasks in a single process when using the Azure portal, but you can also do them separately.

For more information on the terminology used in this article, see [Azure Virtual Desktop terminology](environment-setup.md), and to learn about the service architecture and resilience of the Azure Virtual Desktop service, see [Azure Virtual Desktop service architecture and resilience](service-architecture-resilience.md).

> [!TIP]
> The process covered in this article is an in-depth and adaptable approach to deploying Azure Virtual Desktop. If you want to try Azure Virtual Desktop with a more simple approach to deploy a sample Windows 11 desktop in Azure Virtual Desktop, see [Tutorial: Deploy a sample Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure with a Windows 11 desktop](tutorial-try-deploy-windows-11-desktop.md) or use the [quickstart](quickstart.md).

## Prerequisites

Review the [Prerequisites for Azure Virtual Desktop](prerequisites.md) for a general idea of what's required and supported, such as operating systems (OS), virtual networks, and identity providers. It also includes a list of the [supported Azure regions](prerequisites.md#azure-regions) in which you can deploy host pools, workspaces, and application groups. This list of regions is where the *metadata* for the host pool can be stored. However, session hosts can be located in any Azure region, and on-premises with [Azure Stack HCI](azure-stack-hci-overview.md). For more information about the types of data and locations, see [Data locations for Azure Virtual Desktop](data-locations.md).

Select the relevant tab for your scenario for more prerequisites.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In addition, you need:

- The Azure account you use must be assigned the following built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles as a minimum on a resource group or subscription to create the following resource types. If you want to assign the roles to a resource group, you need to create this first.

   | Resource type | RBAC role |
   |--|--|
   | Host pool, workspace, and application group | [Desktop Virtualization Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-contributor) |
   | Session hosts (Azure) | [Virtual Machine Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) |
   | Session hosts (Azure Stack HCI) | [Azure Stack HCI VM Contributor](/azure-stack/hci/manage/assign-vm-rbac-roles) |

   Alternatively you can assign the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) RBAC role to create all of these resource types.

   For ongoing management of host pools, workspaces, and application groups, you can use more granular roles for each resource type. For more information, see [Built-in Azure RBAC roles for Azure Virtual Desktop](rbac.md).

- To assign users to the application group, you'll also need `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions on the application group. Built-in RBAC roles that include this permission are [User Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) and [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner).

- Don't disable [Windows Remote Management](/windows/win32/winrm/about-windows-remote-management) (WinRM) when creating session hosts using the Azure portal, as [PowerShell DSC](/powershell/dsc/overview) requires it.

- To add session hosts on Azure Stack HCI, you'll also need:

   - An [Azure Stack HCI cluster registered with Azure](/azure-stack/hci/deploy/register-with-azure). Your Azure Stack HCI clusters need to be running a minimum of version 23H2. For more information, see [Azure Stack HCI, version 23H2 deployment overview](/azure-stack/hci/deploy/deployment-introduction). [Azure Arc virtual machine (VM) management](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-overview) is installed automatically.
   
   - A stable connection to Azure from your on-premises network.

   - At least one Windows OS image available on the cluster. For more information, see how to [create VM images using Azure Marketplace images](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-azure-marketplace), [use images in Azure Storage account](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-storage-account), and [use images in local share](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-local-share).
   
   - A logical network that you created on your Azure Stack HCI cluster. DHCP logical networks or static logical networks with automatic IP allocation are supported. For more information, see [Create logical networks for Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-logical-networks).

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

In addition, you need:

- The Azure account you use must be assigned the following built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles as a minimum on a resource group or subscription to create the following resource types. If you want to assign the roles to a resource group, you need to create this first.

   | Resource type | RBAC role |
   |--|--|
   | Host pool, workspace, and application group | [Desktop Virtualization Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-contributor) |
   | Session hosts | [Virtual Machine Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) |

   Alternatively you can assign the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) RBAC role to create all of these resource types.

   For ongoing management of host pools, workspaces, and application groups, you can use more granular roles for each resource type. For more information, see [Built-in Azure RBAC roles for Azure Virtual Desktop](rbac.md).

- If you want to use Azure PowerShell locally, see [Use Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell with Azure Virtual Desktop](cli-powershell.md) to make sure you have the [Az.DesktopVirtualization](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization) PowerShell module installed. Alternatively, use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to create Microsoft Entra joined session hosts, we only support this using the Azure portal.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

In addition, you need:

- The Azure account you use must be assigned the following built-in role-based access control (RBAC) roles as a minimum on a resource group or subscription to create the following resource types. If you want to assign the roles to a resource group, you need to create this first.

   | Resource type | RBAC role |
   |--|--|
   | Host pool, workspace, and application group | [Desktop Virtualization Contributor](rbac.md#desktop-virtualization-contributor) |
   | Session hosts | [Virtual Machine Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#virtual-machine-contributor) |

   Alternatively you can assign the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) RBAC role to create all of these resource types.

   For ongoing management of host pools, workspaces, and application groups, you can use more granular roles for each resource type. For more information, see [Built-in Azure RBAC roles for Azure Virtual Desktop](rbac.md).

- If you want to use Azure CLI locally, see [Use Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell with Azure Virtual Desktop](cli-powershell.md) to make sure you have the [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/desktopvirtualization) Azure CLI extension installed. Alternatively, use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md).
