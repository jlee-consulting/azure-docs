  Transition to Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management for servers
introduction: |

  With the Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can scan compute assets for vulnerabilities. If you're currently using a vulnerability assessment solution other than the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management vulnerability assessment solution, this article provides instructions on transitioning to the integrated Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

  To transition to the integrated Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you can use the Azure portal, use an Azure policy definition (for Azure VMs), or use REST APIs.

      Transition with Azure policy for Azure VMs 
    summary: |
      Follow these steps:
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
      - |
        Navigate to **Policy** > **Definitions**.
      - |
        Search for `Setup subscriptions to transition to an alternative vulnerability assessment solution`. 
      - |
        Select **Assign**.
      - |
        Select a scope and enter an assignment name.
      - |
        Select **Review + create**.
      - |
        Review the information you entered and select **Create**.
        
        This policy ensures that all Virtual Machines (VM) within a selected subscription are safeguarded with the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

      Transition with Defender for Cloud's portal 
    summary: |
      In the Defender for Cloud portal, you have the ability to change the vulnerability assessment solution to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution. 
    steps:
      - |
        Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
      - |
        Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings** 
      - |
        Select the relevant subscription.
      - |
        Locate the Defender for Servers plan and select **Settings**.

      - |
        Toggle `Vulnerability assessment for machines` to **On**.

          If `Vulnerability assessment for machines` was already set to on, select **Edit configuration**

      - |
        Select **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**.
      - |
        Select **Apply**. 
      - |
        Ensure that `Endpoint protection` or `Agentless scanning for machines` are toggled to **On**.

      - |
        Select **Continue**.
      - |
        Select **Save**.

      Transition with REST API
    summary: |
      ### REST API for Azure VMs

      Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

      `PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessmentsSettings/AzureServersSetting?api-version=2022-01-01-preview`
    code: |
      ```json
      {
        "kind": "AzureServersSetting",
        "properties": {
          "selectedProvider": "MdeTvm"
        }
      }
      ```

      Once you complete the transition to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you need to [remove the old vulnerability assessment solution](#remove-the-old-vulnerability-assessment-solution).

      ### REST API for multicloud VMs

      Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

      `PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/securityconnectors/{connectorName}?api-version=2022-08-01-preview`

      ```json

      ## Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution
    
      After migrating to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution in Defender for Cloud, offboard each VM from their old vulnerability assessment solution. To delete the VM extension, you can use the [Remove-AzVMExtension PowerShell cmdlet](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmextension) or a [REST API Delete request](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machine-extensions/delete?tabs=HTTP).
