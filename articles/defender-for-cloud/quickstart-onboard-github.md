# Quickstart: Connect your GitHub repositories to Microsoft Defender for Cloud 

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), GitHub, and Azure DevOps (ADO).

To protect your GitHub-based resources, you can connect your GitHub organizations on the environment settings page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This page provides a simple onboarding experience (including auto discovery). 

By connecting your GitHub repositories to Defender for Cloud, you'll extend Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features to your GitHub resources. These features include:

- **Defender for Cloud's Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features** - Assesses your GitHub resources according to GitHub-specific security recommendations. You can also learn about all of the [recommendations for DevOps](recommendations-reference.md) resources. Resources are assessed for compliance with built-in standards that are specific to DevOps. Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory page](asset-inventory.md) is a multicloud enabled feature that helps you manage your GitHub resources alongside your Azure resources.

- **Defender for Cloud's Cloud Workload Protection features** - Extends Defender for Cloud's threat detection capabilities and advanced defenses to your GitHub resources.
