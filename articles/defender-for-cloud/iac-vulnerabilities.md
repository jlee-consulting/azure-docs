# Discover misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Once you have set up the Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action or Azure DevOps extension, you can configure the YAML configuration file to run a single tool or multiple tools. For example, you can set up the action or extension to run Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning tools only. This can help reduce pipeline run time.

## Prerequisites

- Configure Microsoft Security DevOps for GitHub and/or Azure DevOps based on your source code management system:
  - [Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action](github-action.md)
  - [Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension](azure-devops-extension.md).
- Ensure you have an IaC template in your repository.

## Configure IaC scanning and view the results in GitHub

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com). 

1. Navigate to **`your repository's home page`** > **.github/workflows** > **msdevopssec.yml** that was created in the [prerequisites](github-action.md#configure-the-microsoft-security-devops-github-action-1).    

1. Select **Edit file**.

1. Under the Run Analyzers section, add:

    ```yml
    with:
        categories: 'IaC'
    ```

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Categories are case sensitive.

**Severity level**: 2

#### TA-000020: Audit usage of custom RBAC roles

Audit built-in roles such as 'Owner, Contributer, Reader' instead of custom RBAC roles, which are error prone. Using custom roles is treated as an exception and requires a rigorous review and threat modeling.

**Recommendation**: [Use built-in roles such as 'Owner, Contributer, Reader' instead of custom RBAC roles](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md)

**Severity level**: 3

#### TA-000021: Automation account variables should be encrypted

It is important to enable encryption of Automation account variable assets when storing sensitive data. This step can only be taken at creation time. If you have Automation Account Variables storing sensitive data that are not already encrypted, then you will need to delete them and recreate them as encrypted variables. To apply encryption of the Automation account variable assets, in Azure PowerShell - run [the following command](/powershell/module/az.automation/set-azautomationvariable?view=azps-5.4.0&viewFallbackFrom=azps-1.4.0): `Set-AzAutomationVariable -AutomationAccountName '{AutomationAccountName}' -Encrypted $true -Name '{VariableName}' -ResourceGroupName '{ResourceGroupName}' -Value '{Value}'`

**Recommendation**: [Enable encryption of Automation account variable assets](../automation/shared-resources/variables.md?tabs=azure-powershell)

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000022: Only secure connections to your Azure Cache for Redis should be enabled

Enable only connections via SSL to Redis Cache. Use of secure connections ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking.

**Recommendation**: To [enable only connections via SSL to Redis Cache](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-cache-for-redis-security-baseline?toc=/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/TOC.json#44-encrypt-all-sensitive-information-in-transit), in the [Microsoft.Cache/Redis resource properties](/azure/templates/microsoft.cache/redis?tabs=json#rediscreateproperties-object), update the value of the *enableNonSslPort* property from `true` to `false` or remove the property from the template as the default value is `false`.

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000023: Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

To ensure that only applications from allowed networks, machines, or subnets can access your cluster, restrict access to your Kubernetes Service Management API server. It is recommended to limit access to authorized IP ranges to ensure that only applications from allowed networks can access the cluster.

**Recommendation**: [Restrict access by defining authorized IP ranges](../aks/api-server-authorized-ip-ranges.md) or [set up your API servers as private clusters](../aks/private-clusters.md)

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000024: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be used on Kubernetes Services

To provide granular filtering on the actions that users can perform, use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions in Kubernetes Service Clusters and configure relevant authorization policies. To Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) you must recreate your Kubernetes Service cluster and enable RBAC during the creation process.

**Recommendation**: [Enable RBAC in Kubernetes clusters](../aks/operator-best-practices-identity.md#use-azure-rbac)

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000025: Kubernetes Services should be upgraded to a non-vulnerable Kubernetes version

Upgrade your Kubernetes service cluster to a later Kubernetes version to protect against known vulnerabilities in your current Kubernetes version. [Vulnerability CVE-2019-9946](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9946) has been patched in Kubernetes versions 1.11.9+, 1.12.7+, 1.13.5+, and 1.14.0+. Running on older versions could mean you are not using latest security classes. Usage of such old classes and types can make your application vulnerable.

**Recommendation**: To [upgrade Kubernetes service clusters](../aks/upgrade-cluster.md), in the [Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters resource properties](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters?tabs=json#managedclusterproperties-object), update the *kubernetesVersion* property, setting its value to one of the following versions (making sure to specify the minor version number): 1.11.9+, 1.12.7+, 1.13.5+, or 1.14.0+.

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000026: Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication

Service Fabric clusters should only use Azure Active Directory for client authentication. A Service Fabric cluster offers several entry points to its management functionality, including the web-based Service Fabric Explorer, Visual Studio and PowerShell. Access to the cluster must be controlled using AAD.

**Recommendation**: [Enable AAD client authentication on your Service Fabric clusters](../service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-setup-aad.md)

**Severity level**: 1

#### TA-000027: Transparent Data Encryption on SQL databases should be enabled

Transparent data encryption should be enabled to protect data-at-rest and meet compliance requirements.

**Recommendation**: To [enable transparent data encryption](/azure/azure-sql/database/transparent-data-encryption-tde-overview?tabs=azure-portal), in the [Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/transparentDataEncryption resource properties](/azure/templates/microsoft.sql/servers/databases/transparentdataencryption?tabs=json), add (or update) the value of the *state* property to `enabled`.

**Severity level**: 3

#### TA-000028: SQL servers with auditing to storage account destination should be configured with 90 days retention or higher

Set the data retention for your SQL Server's auditing to storage account destination to at least 90 days.

**Recommendation**: For incident investigation purposes, we recommend setting the data retention for your SQL Server's auditing to storage account destination to at least 90 days, in the [Microsoft.Sql/servers/auditingSettings resource properties](/azure/templates/microsoft.sql/2020-11-01-preview/servers/auditingsettings?tabs=json#serverblobauditingpolicyproperties-object), using the *retentionDays* property. Confirm that you are meeting the necessary retention rules for the regions in which you are operating. This is sometimes required for compliance with regulatory standards.

**Severity level**: 3

#### TA-000029: Azure API Management APIs should use encrypted protocols only

Set the protocols property to only include HTTPS.

**Recommendation**: To use encrypted protocols only, add (or update) the *protocols* property in the [Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis resource properties](/azure/templates/microsoft.apimanagement/service/apis?tabs=json), to only include HTTPS. Allowing any additional protocols (for example, HTTP, WS) is insecure.

**Severity level**: 1
