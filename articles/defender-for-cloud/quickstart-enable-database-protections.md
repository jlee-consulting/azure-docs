# Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud database plans

This article explains how to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud's database (DB) protection for the most common database types that exist on your subscription.

Workload protections are provided through the Microsoft Defender plans that are specific to the types of resources in your subscriptions.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud database security, allows you to protect your entire database estate, by detecting common attacks, supporting enablement, and threat response for the most popular database types in Azure.

The types of protected databases are: 

- Azure SQL Databases 
- SQL servers on machines 
- Open-source relational databases (OSS RDB) 
- Azure Cosmos DB

Database provides protection to engines, and data types, with different attack surface, and security risks. Security detections are made for the specific attack surface of each DB type.  

Defender for Cloudâ€™s database protection detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access, or exploit your databases. Advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/microsoft-uses-threat-intelligence-to-protect-detect-and-respond-to-threats) data are used to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts include steps to mitigate the detected threats, and prevent future attacks. 

You can enable database protection on your subscription, or exclude specific database resource types. 

## Prerequisites

You must have:

- [Subscription Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) access.
