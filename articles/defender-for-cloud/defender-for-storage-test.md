# Trigger a test alert for Microsoft Defender for Storage

After you enable Defender for Storage, you can create a test alert to demonstrate how Defender for Storage recognizes and alerts on security risks.

## Demonstrate Defender for Storage alerts

To test the security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Storage in your environment, generate the alert "Access from a Tor exit node to a storage account" with the following steps:

1. Open a storage account with [Microsoft Defender for Storage enabled](../storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure.md#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-cloud).
1. From the sidebar, select “Containers” and open an existing container or create a new one.

1. Upload a file to that container.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Don't upload a file containing sensitive data.

1. Use the context menu on the uploaded file to select “Generate SAS”.

1. Leave the default options and select **Generate SAS token and URL**.

1. Copy the generated SAS URL.

1. On your local machine, open the Tor browser.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can download Tor from the Tor Project site [https://www.torproject.org/download/](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

1. In the Tor browser, navigate to the SAS URL.

1. Download the file you uploaded in step 3.

    Within two hours you'll get the following security alert from Defender for Cloud:
