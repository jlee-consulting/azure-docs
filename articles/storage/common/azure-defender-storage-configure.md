# Enable Microsoft Defender for Storage

> [!NOTE]
> A new pricing plan is now available for Microsoft Defender for Cloud that charges you according to the number of storage accounts that you protect (per-storage).
>
> In the legacy pricing plan, the cost increases according to the number of analyzed transactions in the storage account (per-transaction). The new per-storage plan fixes costs per storage account, but accounts with an exceptionally high transaction volume incur an overage charge.
>
> For details about the pricing plans, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).


**Microsoft Defender for Storage** is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

Microsoft Defender for Storage continuously analyzes the transactions of [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/), [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), and [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) services. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. Alerts are shown in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with the details of the suspicious activity, appropriate investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations.

Analyzed transactions of Azure Blob Storage include operation types such as `Get Blob`, `Put Blob`, `Get Container ACL`, `List Blobs`, and `Get Blob Properties`. Examples of analyzed Azure Files operation types include `Get File`, `Create File`, `List Files`, `Get File Properties`, and `Put Range`.

**Defender for Storage doesn't access the Storage account data, doesn't require you to enable access logs, and has no impact on Storage performance.**

You can also learn more about Defender for Storage in the [Defender for Storage episode](../../defender-for-cloud/episode-thirteen.md) of the Defender for Cloud in the Field video series.

## Set up Microsoft Defender for Storage for the per-storage pricing plan

> [!NOTE]
> You can only enable the per-storage pricing plan at the subscription level.

With the Defender for Storage per-storage pricing plan, you can configure Microsoft Defender for Storage on your subscriptions in several ways. When the plan is enabled at the subscription level, Microsoft Defender for Storage is automatically enabled for all your existing and new storage accounts created under that subscription.

You can configure Microsoft Defender for Storage on your subscriptions in several ways:

- [Azure portal](#azure-portal)
- [Bicep template](#bicep-template)
- [ARM template](#arm-template)
- [Terraform template](#terraform-template)
- [PowerShell](#powershell)
- [Azure CLI](#azure-cli)
- [REST API](#rest-api)

## FAQ - Microsoft Defender for Storage pricing plans

### Can I switch from an existing per-transaction plan to the per-storage plan?

Yes, you can migrate to the per-storage plan from the Azure portal or all the other supported enablement methods. To migrate to the per-storage plan, [enable the per-storage plan at the subscription level](#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-storage-for-the-per-storage-pricing-plan).

### Can I return to the per-transaction plan after switching to the per-storage plan?

Yes, you can enable the per-transaction to migrate back from the per-storage plan using all enablement methods except for the Azure portal.

### Will you continue supporting the per-transaction plan?

Yes, you can [enable the per-transaction plan](#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-storage-for-the-per-transaction-pricing-plan) from all the enablement methods, except for the Azure portal.

### Can I exclude specific storage accounts from protections in the per-storage plan?

No, you can only enable the per-storage pricing plan for each subscription. All storage accounts in the subscription are protected.

### How long does it take for the per-storage plan to be enabled?

When you enable Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level for the per-storage or per-transaction plans, it takes up to 24 hours for the plan to be enabled.

### Is there any difference in the feature set of the per-storage plan compared to the legacy per-transaction plan?

No. Both the per-storage and per-transaction plans include the same features. The only difference is the pricing plan.

### How can I estimate the cost of the pricing plans?

To estimate the cost of each of the pricing plans for your environment, we created a [pricing estimation workbook](https://aka.ms/dfstoragecosttool) and a PowerShell script that you can run in your environment.
