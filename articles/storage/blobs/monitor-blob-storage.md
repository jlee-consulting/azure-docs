# Monitoring Azure Blob Storage

When you have critical applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data that's generated by Azure Blob Storage and how you can use the features of Azure Monitor to analyze alerts on this data.

## Monitor overview

The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each Blob storage resource includes a brief view of the resource usage, such as requests and hourly billing. This information is useful, but only a small amount of the monitoring data is available. Some of this data is collected automatically and is available for analysis as soon as you create the resource. You can enable additional types of data collection with some configuration.

## What is Azure Monitor?

Azure Blob Storage creates monitoring data by using [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md), which is a full stack monitoring service in Azure. Azure Monitor provides a complete set of features to monitor your Azure resources and resources in other clouds and on-premises.

Start with the article [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md) which describes the following:

- What is Azure Monitor?
- Costs associated with monitoring
- Monitoring data collected in Azure
- Configuring data collection
- Standard tools in Azure for analyzing and alerting on monitoring data

The following sections build on this article by describing the specific data gathered from Azure Storage. Examples show how to configure data collection and analyze this data with Azure tools.

## Monitoring data

Azure Blob Storage collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources, which are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data).

See [Azure Blob Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-blob-storage-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure Blob Storage.

Metrics and logs in Azure Monitor support only Azure Resource Manager storage accounts. Azure Monitor doesn't support classic storage accounts. If you want to use metrics or logs on a classic storage account, you need to migrate to an Azure Resource Manager storage account. For more information, see [Migrate to Azure Resource Manager](../../virtual-machines/migration-classic-resource-manager-overview.md).

You can continue using classic metrics and logs if you want to. In fact, classic metrics and logs are available in parallel with metrics and logs in Azure Monitor. The support remains in place until Azure Storage ends the service on legacy metrics and logs.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.

To collect resource logs, you must create a diagnostic setting. When you create the setting, choose **blob** as the type of storage that you want to enable logs for. Then, specify one of the following categories of operations for which you want to collect logs.

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| StorageRead | Read operations on objects. |
| StorageWrite | Write operations on objects. |
| StorageDelete | Delete operations on objects. |

> [!NOTE]
> Data Lake Storage Gen2 doesn't appear as a storage type. That's because Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a set of capabilities available to Blob storage.

## Creating a diagnostic setting

This section shows you how to create a diagnostic setting by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, and the Azure CLI. This section provides steps specific to Azure Storage. For general guidance about how to create a diagnostic setting, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md).

> [!TIP] 
> You can also create a diagnostic setting by using an Azure Resource manager template or by using a policy definition. A policy definition can ensure that a diagnostic setting is created for every account that is created or updated. 
>
> This section doesn't describe templates or policy definitions. 
>
> - To view an Azure Resource Manager template that creates a diagnostic setting, see [Diagnostic setting for Azure Storage](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.md#diagnostic-setting-for-azure-storage). 
>
> - To learn how to create a diagnostic setting by using a policy definition, see [Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Storage](../common/policy-reference.md).

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Navigate to your storage account.

3. In the **Monitoring** section, click **Diagnostic settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![portal - Diagnostics logs](media/monitor-blob-storage/diagnostic-logs-settings-pane.png)

4. Choose **blob** as the type of storage that you want to enable logs for.

5. Click **Add diagnostic setting**.

   The **Diagnostic settings** page appears.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Resource logs page](media/monitor-blob-storage/diagnostic-logs-page.png)

6. In the **Name** field of the page, enter a name for this Resource log setting. Then, select which operations you want logged (read, write, and delete operations), and where you want the logs to be sent.

#### Archive logs to a storage account

If you choose to archive your logs to a storage account, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the storage account. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You can't send logs to the same storage account that you are monitoring with this setting. This would lead to recursive logs in which a log entry describes the writing of another log entry. You must create an account or use another existing account to store log information.

1. Select the **Archive to a storage account** checkbox, and then select the **Configure** button.

2. In the **Storage account** drop-down list, select the storage account that you want to archive your logs to, and then select the **Save** button.

   [!INCLUDE [no retention policy](../../../includes/azure-storage-logs-retention-policy.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > Before you choose a storage account as the export destination, see [Archive Azure resource logs](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-storage) to understand prerequisites on the storage account.

#### Stream logs to Azure Event Hubs

If you choose to stream your logs to an event hub, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the event hub. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You'll need access to an existing event hub, or you'll need to create one before you complete this step.

1. Select the **Stream to an event hub** checkbox, and then select the **Configure** button.

2. In the **Select an event hub** pane, choose the namespace, name, and policy name of the event hub that you want to stream your logs to.

3. Select the **Save** button.

#### Send logs to Azure Log Analytics

1. Select the **Send to Log Analytics** checkbox, select a log analytics workspace, and then select the **Save** button. You'll need access to an existing log analytics workspace, or you'll need to create one before you complete this step.

[!INCLUDE [no retention policy log analytics](../../../includes/azure-storage-logs-retention-policy-log-analytics.md)]

#### Send to a partner solution

You can also send platform metrics and logs to certain Azure Monitor partners. You must first install a partner integration into your subscription. Configuration options will vary by partner. Check the [Azure Monitor partner integrations documentation](../../partner-solutions/overview.md) for details.

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Open a Windows PowerShell command window, and sign in to your Azure subscription by using the `Connect-AzAccount` command. Then, follow the on-screen directions.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

2. Set your active subscription to subscription of the storage account that you want to enable logging for.

   ```powershell
   Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <subscription-id>
   ```

#### Archive logs to a storage account

If you choose to archive your logs to a storage account, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the storage account. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You can't send logs to the same storage account that you are monitoring with this setting. This would lead to recursive logs in which a log entry describes the writing of another log entry. You must create an account or use another existing account to store log information.

Enable logs by using the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting](/powershell/module/az.monitor/set-azdiagnosticsetting) PowerShell cmdlet along with the `StorageAccountId` parameter.

```powershell
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId <storage-service-resource-id> -StorageAccountId <storage-account-resource-id> -Enabled $true -Category <operations-to-log>
```

Replace the `<storage-service-resource--id>` placeholder in this snippet with the resource ID of the blob service. You can find the resource ID in the Azure portal by opening the **Endpoints** page of your storage account.

You can use `StorageRead`, `StorageWrite`, and `StorageDelete` for the value of the **Category** parameter.

[!INCLUDE [no retention policy](../../../includes/azure-storage-logs-retention-policy.md)]

Here's an example:

`Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/blobServices/default -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myloggingstorageaccount -Enabled $true -Category StorageWrite,StorageDelete`

For a description of each parameter, see the [Archive Azure Resource logs via Azure PowerShell](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-storage).

#### Stream logs to an event hub

If you choose to stream your logs to an event hub, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the event hub. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You'll need access to an existing event hub, or you'll need to create one before you complete this step.

Enable logs by using the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting](/powershell/module/az.monitor/set-azdiagnosticsetting) PowerShell cmdlet with the `EventHubAuthorizationRuleId` parameter.

```powershell
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId <storage-service-resource-id> -EventHubAuthorizationRuleId <event-hub-namespace-and-key-name> -Enabled $true -Category <operations-to-log>
```

Here's an example:

`Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/blobServices/default -EventHubAuthorizationRuleId /subscriptions/20884142-a14v3-4234-5450-08b10c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/myeventhubnamespace/authorizationrules/RootManageSharedAccessKey -Enabled $true -Category StorageDelete`

For a description of each parameter, see the [Stream Data to Event Hubs via PowerShell cmdlets](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-event-hubs).

#### Send logs to Log Analytics

Enable logs by using the [Set-AzDiagnosticSetting](/powershell/module/az.monitor/set-azdiagnosticsetting) PowerShell cmdlet with the `WorkspaceId` parameter. You'll need access to an existing log analytics workspace, or you'll need to create one before you complete this step.

```powershell
Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId <storage-service-resource-id> -WorkspaceId <log-analytics-workspace-resource-id> -Enabled $true -Category <operations-to-log>
```

[!INCLUDE [no retention policy log analytics](../../../includes/azure-storage-logs-retention-policy-log-analytics.md)]

Here's an example:

`Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/blobServices/default -WorkspaceId /subscriptions/208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/my-analytic-workspace -Enabled $true -Category StorageDelete`

For more information, see [Stream Azure Resource Logs to Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#send-to-log-analytics-workspace).

#### Send to a partner solution

You can also send platform metrics and logs to certain Azure Monitor partners. You must first install a partner integration into your subscription. Configuration options will vary by partner. Check the [Azure Monitor partner integrations documentation](../../partner-solutions/overview.md) for details.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. First, open the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md), or if you've [installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI locally, open a command console application such as Windows PowerShell.

2. If your identity is associated with more than one subscription, then set your active subscription to subscription of the storage account that you want to enable logs for.

   ```azurecli
      az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```
   
   Replace the `<subscription-id>` placeholder value with the ID of your subscription.

#### Archive logs to a storage account

If you choose to archive your logs to a storage account, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the storage account. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You can't send logs to the same storage account that you are monitoring with this setting. This would lead to recursive logs in which a log entry describes the writing of another log entry. You must create an account or use another existing account to store log information.

Enable logs by using the [az monitor diagnostic-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az-monitor-diagnostic-settings-create) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name <setting-name> --storage-account <storage-account-name> --resource <storage-service-resource-id> --resource-group <resource-group> --logs '[{"category": <operations>, "enabled": true }]'
```

Replace the `<storage-service-resource--id>` placeholder in this snippet with the resource ID Blob storage service. You can find the resource ID in the Azure portal by opening the **Endpoints** page of your storage account.

You can use `StorageRead`, `StorageWrite`, and `StorageDelete` for the value of the **category** parameter.

[!INCLUDE [no retention policy](../../../includes/azure-storage-logs-retention-policy.md)]

Here's an example:

`az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name setting1 --storage-account mystorageaccount --resource /subscriptions/938841be-a40c-4bf4-9210-08bcf06c09f9/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myloggingstorageaccount/blobServices/default --resource-group myresourcegroup --logs '[{"category": StorageWrite}]'`

For a description of each parameter, see the [Archive Resource logs via the Azure CLI](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#send-to-azure-storage).

#### Stream logs to an event hub

If you choose to stream your logs to an event hub, you'll pay for the volume of logs that are sent to the event hub. For specific pricing, see the **Platform Logs** section of the [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/#platform-logs) page. You'll need access to an existing event hub, or you'll need to create one before you complete this step.

Enable logs by using the [az monitor diagnostic-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/diagnostic-settings#az-monitor-diagnostic-settings-create) command.

```azurecli-interactive

## Analyzing metrics

For a list of all Azure Monitor support metrics, which includes Azure Blob Storage, see [Azure Monitor supported metrics](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can analyze metrics for Azure Storage with metrics from other Azure services by using Metrics Explorer. Open Metrics Explorer by choosing **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. For details on using this tool, see [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md).

This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-blob-storage/access-metrics-portal.png)

For metrics that support dimensions, you can filter the metric with the desired dimension value. This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level on a specific operation by selecting values for the **API Name** dimension.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics with dimension in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-blob-storage/access-metrics-portal-with-dimension.png)

For a complete list of the dimensions that Azure Storage supports, see [Metrics dimensions](monitor-blob-storage-reference.md#metrics-dimensions).

Metrics for Azure Blob Storage are in these namespaces:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

#### List the metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Blob storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetricDefinition](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricdefinition) cmdlet.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the Blob storage service. You can find these resource IDs on the **Endpoints** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetricDefinition -ResourceId $resourceId
```

#### Reading metric values

You can read account-level metric values of your storage account or the Blob storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetric](/powershell/module/Az.Monitor/Get-AzMetric) cmdlet.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricName "UsedCapacity" -TimeGrain 01:00:00
```

#### Reading metric values with dimensions

When a metric supports dimensions, you can read metric values and filter them by using dimension values. Use the [Get-AzMetric](/powershell/module/Az.Monitor/Get-AzMetric) cmdlet.

```powershell
$resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
$dimFilter = [String](New-AzMetricFilter -Dimension ApiName -Operator eq -Value "GetBlob" 3> $null)
Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricName Transactions -TimeGrain 01:00:00 -MetricFilter $dimFilter -AggregationType "Total"
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

For a list of all Azure Monitor support metrics, which includes Azure Blob Storage, see [Azure Monitor supported metrics](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

#### List the account-level metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Blob storage service. Use the [az monitor metrics list-definitions](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list-definitions) command.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the Blob storage service. You can find these resource IDs on the **Endpoints** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```azurecli
   az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource <resource-ID>
```

#### Read account-level metric values

You can read the metric values of your storage account or the Blob storage service. Use the [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) command.

```azurecli
   az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "UsedCapacity" --interval PT1H
```

#### Reading metric values with dimensions

When a metric supports dimensions, you can read metric values and filter them by using dimension values. Use the [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) command.

```azurecli
az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "Transactions" --interval PT1H --filter "ApiName eq 'GetBlob' " --aggregation "Total" 
```

---

## Analyze metrics by using code

Azure Monitor provides the [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor/) to read metric definition and values. The [sample code](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/monitor-dotnet-metrics-api/) shows how to use the SDK with different parameters. You need to use `0.18.0-preview` or a later version for storage metrics.

In these examples, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the Blob storage service. You can find these resource IDs on the **Endpoints** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

Replace the `<subscription-ID>` variable with the ID of your subscription. For guidance on how to obtain values for `<tenant-ID>`, `<application-ID>`, and `<AccessKey>`, see [Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md).

#### List the account-level metric definition

The following example shows how to list a metric definition at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ListStorageMetricDefinition()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;
        IEnumerable<MetricDefinition> metricDefinitions = await readOnlyClient.MetricDefinitions.ListAsync(resourceUri: resourceId, cancellationToken: new CancellationToken());

        foreach (var metricDefinition in metricDefinitions)
        {
            // Enumrate metric definition:
            //    Id
            //    ResourceId
            //    Name
            //    Unit
            //    MetricAvailabilities
            //    PrimaryAggregationType
            //    Dimensions
            //    IsDimensionRequired
        }
    }

```

#### Reading account-level metric values

The following example shows how to read `UsedCapacity` data at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValue()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;

        Response = await readOnlyClient.Metrics.ListAsync(
            resourceUri: resourceId,
            timespan: timeSpan,
            interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
            metricnames: "UsedCapacity",

            aggregation: "Average",
            resultType: ResultType.Data,
            cancellationToken: CancellationToken.None);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            // Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

#### Reading multidimensional metric values

For multidimensional metrics, you need to define metadata filters if you want to read metric data on specific dimension values.

The following example shows how to read metric data on the metric supporting multidimension:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValueTest()
    {
        // Resource ID for blob storage
        var resourceId = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/blobServices/default";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID}";
        // How to identify Tenant ID, Application ID and Access Key: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;
        // It's applicable to define meta data filter when a metric support dimension
        // More conditions can be added with the 'or' and 'and' operators, example: BlobType eq 'BlockBlob' or BlobType eq 'PageBlob'
        ODataQuery<MetadataValue> odataFilterMetrics = new ODataQuery<MetadataValue>(
            string.Format("BlobType eq '{0}'", "BlockBlob"));

        Response = readOnlyClient.Metrics.List(
                        resourceUri: resourceId,
                        timespan: timeSpan,
                        interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
                        metricnames: "BlobCapacity",

## Analyzing logs

You can access resource logs either as a blob in a storage account, as event data, or through Log Analytic queries.

For a detailed reference of the fields that appear in these logs, see [Azure Blob Storage monitoring data reference](monitor-blob-storage-reference.md).

Log entries are created only if there are requests made against the service endpoint. For example, if a storage account has activity in its blob endpoint but not in its table or queue endpoints, only logs that pertain to the blob service are created. Azure Storage logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.

### Log authenticated requests

 The following types of authenticated requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Failed requests, including timeout, throttling, network, authorization, and other errors
- Requests that use a shared access signature (SAS) or OAuth, including failed and successful requests
- Requests to analytics data (classic log data in the **$logs** container and class metric data in the **$metric** tables)

Requests made by the Blob storage service itself, such as log creation or deletion, aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage log format](monitor-blob-storage-reference.md).

### Log anonymous requests

 The following types of anonymous requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Server errors
- Timeout errors for both client and server
- Failed GET requests with the error code 304 (Not Modified)

All other failed anonymous requests aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage log format](monitor-blob-storage-reference.md).

### Accessing logs in a storage account

Logs appear as blobs stored to a container in the target storage account. Data is collected and stored inside a single blob as a line-delimited JSON payload. The name of the blob follows this naming convention:

`https://<destination-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-<storage-operation>/resourceId=/subscriptions/<subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<source-storage-account>/blobServices/default/y=<year>/m=<month>/d=<day>/h=<hour>/m=<minute>/PT1H.json`

Here's an example:

`https://mylogstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-storagewrite/resourceId=/subscriptions/`<br>`208841be-a4v3-4234-9450-08b90c09f4/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount/blobServices/default/y=2019/m=07/d=30/h=23/m=12/PT1H.json`

### Accessing logs in an event hub

Logs sent to an event hub aren't stored as a file, but you can verify that the event hub received the log information. In the Azure portal, go to your event hub and verify that the **incoming messages** count is greater than zero.

![Audit logs](media/monitor-blob-storage/event-hub-log.png)

You can access and read log data that's sent to your event hub by using security information and event management and monitoring tools. For more information, see [What can I do with the monitoring data being sent to my event hub?](../../azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs.md).

### Accessing logs in a Log Analytics workspace

You can access logs sent to a Log Analytics workspace by using Azure Monitor log queries.

For more information, see [Get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md).

Data is stored in the **StorageBlobLog** table. Logs for Data Lake Storage Gen2 do not appear in a dedicated table. That's because Data Lake Storage Gen2 is not service. It's a set of capabilities that you can enable in your storage account. If you've enabled those capabilities, logs will continue to appear in the StorageBlobLog table.

#### Sample Kusto queries

Here are some queries that you can enter in the **Log search** bar to help you monitor your Blob storage. These queries work with the [new language](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the storage account resource group menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current resource group. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource group. If you want to run a query that includes data from other resources or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

Use these queries to help you monitor your Azure Storage accounts:

- To list the 10 most common errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by StatusText
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations that caused the most errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations with the longest end-to-end latency over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | top 10 by DurationMs desc
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, DurationMs, ServerLatencyMs, ClientLatencyMs = DurationMs - ServerLatencyMs
    ```

- To list all operations that caused server-side throttling errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText contains "ServerBusy"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, StatusCode, StatusText
    ```

- To list all requests with anonymous access over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and AuthenticationType == "Anonymous"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, AuthenticationType, Uri
    ```

- To create a pie chart of operations used over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | sort by count_ desc
    | render piechart
    ```
