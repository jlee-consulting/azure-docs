# Azure Video Indexer account types

[!INCLUDE [accounts](./includes/arm-accounts.md)]

This article gives an overview of Azure Video Indexer accounts types and provides links to other articles for more details.

## A trial account

The first time you visit the [Azure Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website, a trial account is automatically created. The trial Azure Video Indexer account has limitation on number of indexing minutes, support, and SLA.

With a trial, account Azure Video Indexer provides:

* up to 600 minutes of free indexing to the [Azure Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website users and 
* up to 2400 minutes of free indexing to users that subscribe to the Azure Video Indexer API on the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/avam-dev-portal).

When using the trial account, you don't have to set up an Azure subscription.

The trial account option is not available on the Azure Government cloud. For other Azure Government limitations, see [Limitations of Azure Video Indexer on Azure Government](connect-to-azure.md#limitations-of-azure-video-indexer-on-azure-government).

## A paid (unlimited) account

You can later create a paid account where you're not limited by the quota. Two types of paid accounts are available to you: Azure Resource Manager (recommended) and classic. The main difference between the two is account management platform. 

* ARM-based accounts management is built on Azure, which enables using [Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/overview.md) (recommended).
* Classic accounts are built on the API Management.

With the paid option, you pay for indexed minutes, for more information, see [Azure Video Indexer pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/video-indexer/).

When creating a new paid account, you need to connect the Azure Video Indexer account to your Azure subscription and an Azure Media Services account. 

## Create accounts

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to use Azure Video Indexer ARM-based accounts. 
    
* [Create an ARM-based (paid) account in Azure portal](create-account-portal.md). To create an account with an API, see [Accounts](/rest/api/videoindexer/accounts?branch=videoindex)

    > [!TIP]
    > Make sure you are signed in with the correct domain to the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/). For details, see [Switch tenants](switch-tenants-portal.md).  
* [Upgrade a trial account to an ARM-based (paid) account and import your content for free](import-content-from-trial.md).  
* If you have a classic (paid) account, [connect an existing classic Azure Video Indexer account to an ARM-based account](connect-classic-account-to-arm.md).

   Unless your code or infrastructure prevents you from moving from existing classic accounts, you should start using ARM-based accounts.
