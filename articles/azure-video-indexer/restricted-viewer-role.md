# Manage access with the Video Indexer Restricted Viewer role

Azure Video Indexer enables managing user access to the Azure Video Indexer resource at the account level with the following built-in role: **Video Indexer Restricted Viewer**. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **Video Indexer Restricted Viewer** built-in role is only available for ARM-based (recommended) accounts, not classic accounts. If you have an existing classic account, see [Connect an existing classic paid account to an ARM-based account](connect-classic-account-to-arm.md).

Users with the owner or administrator Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) permissions can assign the **Video Indexer Restricted Viewer** role to  Azure AD users or security groups for an account. For information on how to assign roles, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md). 

The limited access Video Indexer Restricted Viewer role is intended for the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) users as its permitted actions relate to the [Azure Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) experience.
