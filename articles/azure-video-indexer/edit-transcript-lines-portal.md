# Insert or remove transcript lines in Video Indexer portal 

This article explains how to insert or remove a transcript line in Azure Video Indexer portal.

## Add new line to the transcript timeline 

While in the edit mode, hover between two transcription lines. You'll find a gap between **ending time** of the **transcript line** and the beginning of the following transcript line, user should see the following **add new transcription line** option.

After clicking the add new transcription line, there will be an option to add the new text and the time stamp for the new line. Enter the text, choose the time stamp for the new line, and select **save**. Default timestamp is the gap between the previous and next transcript line.

If there isnâ€™t an option to add a new line, you can adjust the end/start time of the relevant transcript lines to fit a new line in your desired place. 

Choose an existing line in the transcript line, click the **three dots** icon, select edit and change the time stamp accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> New lines will not appear as part of the **From transcript edits** in the **Content model customization** under languages.
