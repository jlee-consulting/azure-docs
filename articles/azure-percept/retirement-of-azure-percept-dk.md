# Retirement of Azure Percept DK

The [Azure Percept](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-percept/) public preview will be evolving to support new edge device platforms and developer experiences. As part of this evolution the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory and associated supporting Azure services for the Percept DK will be retired March 30, 2023.
 
## How does this change affect me?

- After March 30, 2023, the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory will no longer be supported by any Azure services including Azure Percept Studio, OS updates, containers updates, view web stream, and Custom Vision integration. 
- Microsoft will no longer provide customer success support for the Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory and any associated supporting services for the Percept DK.
- Existing Custom Vision and Custom Speech projects created using Percept Studio for the Percept DK will not be deleted and billing if applicable will continue. You can no longer modify or use your project with Percept Studio. 
 
## Recommended action

You should plan to close the resources and projects associated with the Azure Percept Studio and DK to avoid unanticipated billing of backend resources and projects will continue to bill after retirement.

| Question             | Answer                       | 
|----------------------|------------------------------|             
| Why is this change being made?                 | The Azure Percept DK, Percept Audio Accessory, and Azure Percept Studio were in preview stages. This is like a public beta. Previews give customers the opportunity to try the latest and greatest software and hardware. Due to the preview nature of the software and hardware retirements may occur.               | 
| What is changing?                              | Azure Percept DK and Audio Accessory will no longer be supported by any Azure services including Azure Percept Studio and Updates.    | 
| When is this change occurring?                 | On March 30, 2023. Until this date your DK and Studio will function as-is and updates and customer support will be offered. After this date, all updates and customer support will stop.    | 
| Will my projects be deleted?                   | Your projects remain in the underlying Azure Services they were created in (example: Custom Vision, Speech Studio, etc.). They won't be deleted due to this retirement. You can no longer modify or use your project with Percept Studio.   | 
| Do I need to do anything before March 30, 2023?    | Yes, you will need to close the resources and projects associated with the Azure Percept Studio and DK to avoid future billing, as these backend resources and projects will continue to bill after retirement.    | 
| Will my device still power on?                | The various backend services that allow the DK and Audio Accessory to fully function will be shut down upon retirement, rending the DK and Audio Accessory effectively unusable. The SoMs, such as the camera and Audio Accessory, will no longer be identified by the DK after retirement and thus effectively unusable.  |
