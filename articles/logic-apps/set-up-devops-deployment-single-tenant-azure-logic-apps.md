# Set up DevOps deployment for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps (preview) 

This article shows how to deploy a single-tenant based logic app project from Visual Studio Code to your infrastructure by using DevOps tools and processes. Based on whether you prefer GitHub or Azure DevOps for deployment, choose the path and tools that work best for your scenario. You can use the included samples that contain example logic app projects plus examples for Azure deployment using either GitHub or Azure DevOps. For more information about DevOps for single-tenant, review [DevOps deployment for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps (preview)](devops-deployment-single-tenant-azure-logic-apps.md).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A single-tenant based logic app project created with [Visual Studio Code and the Azure Logic Apps (Preview) extension](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code.md#prerequisites).

  If you don't already have a logic app project or infrastructure set up, you can use the included sample projects to deploy an example app and infrastructure, based on the source and deployment options you prefer to use. For more information about these sample projects and the resources included to run the example logic app, review [Deploy your infrastructure](#deploy-infrastructure).

- If you want to deploy to Azure, you need an existing **Logic App (Preview)** resource created in Azure. To quickly create an empty logic app resource, review [Create single-tenant based logic app workflows - Portal](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-azure-portal.md).

## Deploy infrastructure resources

If you don't already have a logic app project or infrastructure set up, you can use the following sample projects to deploy an example app and infrastructure, based on the source and deployment options you prefer to use:

- [GitHub sample for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/tree/master/github-sample)

  This sample includes an example logic app project for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps plus examples for Azure deployment and GitHub Actions.

- [Azure DevOps sample for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/tree/master/azure-devops-sample)

  This sample includes an example logic app project for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps plus examples for Azure deployment and Azure Pipelines.
  
Both samples include the following resources that a logic app uses to run.

| Resource name | Required | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Logic App (Preview) | Yes | This Azure resource contains the workflows that run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. |
| Premium or App Service hosting plan | Yes | This Azure resource specifies the hosting resources to use for running your logic app, such as compute, processing, storage, networking, and so on. |
| Azure storage account | Yes, for stateless workflows | This Azure resource stores the metadata, state, inputs, outputs, run history, and other information about your workflows. |
| Application Insights | Optional | This Azure resource provides monitoring capabilities for your workflows. |
| API connections | Optional, if none exist | These Azure resources define any managed API connections that your workflows use to run managed connector operations, such as Office 365, SharePoint, and so on. <p><p>**Important**: In your logic app project, the **connections.json** file contains metadata, endpoints, and keys for any managed API connections and Azure functions that your workflows use. To use different connections and functions in each environment, make sure that you parameterize the **connections.json** file and update the endpoints. <p><p>For more information, review [API connection resources and access policies](#api-connection-resources). |
| Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template | Optional | This Azure resource defines a baseline infrastructure deployment that you can reuse or [export](../azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-export-template.md). The template also includes the required access policies, for example, to use managed API connections. <p><p>**Important**: Exporting the ARM template won't include all the related parameters for any API connection resources that your workflows use. For more information, review [Find API connection parameters](#find-api-connection-parameters). |

## API connection resources and access policies

In single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, every managed or API connection resource in your workflows requires an associated access policy. This policy needs your logic app's identity to provide the correct permissions for accessing the managed connector infrastructure. The included sample projects include an ARM template that includes all the necessary infrastructure resources, including these access policies.

The following diagram shows the dependencies between your logic app project and infrastructure resources:

### Find API connection parameters

If your workflows use managed API connections, using the export template capability won't include all related parameters. In an ARM template, every [API connection resource definition](logic-apps-azure-resource-manager-templates-overview.md#connection-resource-definitions) has the following general format:

```json
{
   "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections",
   "apiVersion": "2016–06–01",
   "location": "[parameters('location')]",
   "name": "[parameters('connectionName')]",
   "properties": {}
}
```

To find the values that you need to use in the `properties` object for completing the connection resource definition, you can use the following API for a specific connector:

`PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{location}/managedApis/{connector-name}?api-version=2018–07–01-preview`

In the response, find the `connectionParameters` object, which contains all the information necessary for you to complete resource definition for that specific connector. The following example shows an example resource definition for a SQL managed connection:

```json
{
   "type": "Microsoft.Web/connections",
   "apiVersion": "2016–06–01",
   "location": "[parameters('location')]",
   "name": "[parameters('connectionName')]",
   "properties": {
      "displayName": "sqltestconnector",
      "api": {
         "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription-ID}/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/{location}/managedApis/sql"
      },
      "parameterValues": {
         "authType": "windows", 
         "database": "TestDB",
         "password": "TestPassword",
         "server": "TestServer",
         "username": "TestUserName"
      }
   }
}
```

As an alternative, you can review the network trace for when you create a connection in the Logic Apps designer. Find the `PUT` call to the managed API for the connector as previously described, and review the request body for all the information you need.

## Deploy logic app resources (zip deploy)

After you push your logic app project to your source repository, you can set up build and release pipelines that deploy logic apps to infrastructure inside or outside Azure.

### Build your project

To set up a build pipeline based on your logic app project type, follow the corresponding actions:

* Nuget-based: The NuGet-based project structure is based on the .NET Framework. To build these projects, make sure to follow the build steps for .NET Standard. For more information, review the [Create a NuGet package using MSBuild](/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-msbuild) documentation.

* Bundle-based: The extension bundle-based project isn't language specific and doesn't require any language-specific build steps. You can use any method to zip your project files.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure that the .zip file includes all workflow folders, configuration files such as host.json, connections.json, and any other related files.

### Release to Azure

To set up a release pipeline that deploys to Azure, choose the associated option for GitHub, Azure DevOps, or Azure CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Logic Apps currently doesn't support Azure deployment slots.

#### [GitHub](#tab/github)

For GitHub deployments, you can deploy your logic app by using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions), for example, the GitHub Action in Azure Functions. This action requires that you pass through the following information:

* Your build artifact
* The logic app name to use for deployment
* Your publish profile

```yaml
- name: 'Run Azure Functions Action'
  uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
  id: fa
  with:
   app-name: {your-logic-app-name}
   package: '{your-build-artifact}.zip'
   publish-profile: {your-logic-app-publish-profile}
```

For more information, review the [Continuous delivery by using GitHub Action](../azure-functions/functions-how-to-github-actions.md) documentation.

#### [Azure DevOps](#tab/azure-devops)

For Azure DevOps deployments, you can deploy your logic app by using the [Azure Function App Deploy task](/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-function-app) in Azure Pipelines. This action requires that you pass through the following information:

* Your build artifact
* The logic app name to use for deployment
* Your publish profile

```yaml
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1
  displayName: 'Deploy logic app workflows'
  inputs:
     azureSubscription: '{your-service-connection}'
     appType: 'workflowapp'
     appName: '{your-logic-app-name}'
     package: '{your-build-artifact}.zip'
     deploymentMethod: 'zipDeploy'
```

For more information, review the [Deploy an Azure Function using Azure Pipelines](/devops/pipelines/targets/azure-functions-windows) documentation.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

If you use other deployment tools, you can deploy your logic app by using the Azure CLI commands for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps. For example, to deploy your zipped artifact to an Azure resource group, run the following CLI command:

`az logicapp deployment source config-zip -g {your-resource-group} --name {your-logic-app-name} --src {your-build-artifact}.zip`

---

### Release to containers

If you containerize your logic app, deployment works mostly the same as any other container you deploy and manage. For more information about containerizing logic apps and deploying to Docker, review [Deploy your logic app to a Docker container from Visual Studio Code](create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code.md#deploy-to-docker).

For examples that show how to implement an end-to-end container build and deployment pipeline, review [CI/CD for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/architecture/cicd-for-containers/).
