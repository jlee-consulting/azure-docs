# Add XSLT maps for XML transformation in Azure Logic Apps

To transfer XML data between formats for enterprise integration scenarios in Azure Logic Apps, your logic app resource can use maps, or more specifically, Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) maps. A map is an XML document that describes how to convert data from an XML document into another format.

For example, suppose you regularly receive B2B orders or invoices from a customer who uses the YearMonthDay date format (YYYYMMDD). However, your organization uses the MonthDayYear date format (MMDDYYYY). You can define and use a map that transforms the YYYYMMDD format to the MMDDYYYY format before storing the order or invoice details in your customer activity database.

With a map, you can define a basic transformation, such as copying a name and address from one document to another. Or, you can create more complex transformations using the out-of-the-box map operations.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Logic Apps allocates finite memory for processing XML transformations. If you create logic apps based on the 
> [**Logic App (Consumption)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-type-and-host-environment-differences), 
> and your map or payload transformations have high memory consumption, such transformations might fail, resulting in 
> out of memory errors. To avoid this scenario, consider these options:
>
> * Edit your maps or payloads to reduce memory consumption.
>
> * Create your logic apps using the [**Logic App (Standard)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-type-and-host-environment-differences) instead.
>
>   These workflows run in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, which offers dedicated and flexible options for compute and memory resources. 
>   However, the Standard logic app resource type currently doesn't support referencing external assemblies from maps. Also, only Extensible 
>   Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) 1.0 is currently supported.

If you're new to logic apps, review [What is Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-overview.md)? For more information about B2B enterprise integration, review [B2B enterprise integration workflows with Azure Logic Apps and Enterprise Integration Pack](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* To create maps, you can use the following tools:

  * Visual Studio 2019 and the [Microsoft Azure Logic Apps Enterprise Integration Tools Extension](https://aka.ms/vsenterpriseintegrationtools).

  * Visual Studio 2015 and the [Microsoft Azure Logic Apps Enterprise Integration Tools for Visual Studio 2015 2.0](https://aka.ms/vsmapsandschemas) extension.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't install the extension alongside the BizTalk Server extension. Having both extensions might 
   > produce unexpected behavior. Make sure that you only have one of these extensions installed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > On high resolution monitors, you might experience a [display problem with the map designer](/visualstudio/designers/disable-dpi-awareness) 
   > in Visual Studio. To resolve this display problem, either [restart Visual Studio in DPI-unaware mode](/visualstudio/designers/disable-dpi-awareness#restart-visual-studio-as-a-dpi-unaware-process), 
   > or add the [DPIUNAWARE registry value](/visualstudio/designers/disable-dpi-awareness#add-a-registry-entry).

* An [integration account resource](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) where you define and store artifacts for use in your enterprise integration and business-to-business (B2B) workflows. This resource has to meet the following requirements:

  * Is associated with the same Azure subscription as your logic app resource.

  * Exists in the same location or Azure region as your logic app resource where you plan to use the **Transform XML** action.

  * If you use the [**Logic App (Consumption)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-type-and-host-environment-differences), you have to [link your integration account to your logic app resource](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md#link-account) before you can use your artifacts in your workflow.

    To create and add maps for use in **Logic App (Consumption)** workflows, you don't need a logic app resource yet. However, when you're ready to use those maps in your workflows, your logic app resource requires a linked integration account that stores those maps.

  * If you use the [**Logic App (Standard)** resource type](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-type-and-host-environment-differences), you need an existing logic app resource because you don't store maps in your integration account. Instead, you can directly add maps to your logic app resource using either the Azure portal or Visual Studio Code. Only XSLT 1.0 is currently supported. You can then use these maps across multiple workflows within the *same logic app resource*.

    You still need an integration account for your partners, agreements, and certificates along with using the [AS2](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-as2.md), [X12](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12.md), [EDIFACT](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-edifact.md), and [RosettaNet](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-rosettanet.md) operations. However, you don't need to link your logic app resource to your integration account, so the linking capability doesn't exist. Your integration account has to still meet other requirements, such as using the same Azure subscription and existing in the same location as your logic app.

* While **Logic App (Consumption)** supports referencing external assemblies from maps, **Logic App (Standard)** currently doesn't support this capability. Referencing an assembly enables direct calls from XSLT maps to custom .NET code.

  * You need a 64-bit assembly. The transform service runs a 64-bit process, so 32-bit assemblies aren't supported. If you have the source code for a 32-bit assembly, recompile the code into a 64-bit assembly. If you don't have the source code, but you obtained the binary from a third-party provider, get the 64-bit version from that provider. For example, some vendors provide assemblies in packages that have both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If you have the option, use the 64-bit version instead.

  * You have to upload *both the assembly and the map* in a specific order to your integration account. Make sure you [*upload your assembly first*](#add-assembly), and then upload the map that references the assembly.

  * If your assembly is [2 MB or smaller](#smaller-map), you can add your assembly and map to your integration account *directly* from the Azure portal. However, if your assembly or map is bigger than 2 MB but not bigger than the [size limit for assemblies or maps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#artifact-capacity-limits), you can use an Azure blob container where you can upload your assembly and that container's location. That way, you can provide that location later when you add the assembly to your integration account. For this task, you need these items:

    | Item | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | [Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md) | In this account, create an Azure blob container for your assembly. Learn [how to create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md). |
    | Blob container | In this container, you can upload your assembly. You also need this container's content URI location when you add the assembly to your integration account. Learn how to [create a blob container](../storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal.md). |
    | [Azure Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md) | This tool helps you more easily manage storage accounts and blob containers. To use Storage Explorer, either [download and install Azure Storage Explorer](https://www.storageexplorer.com/). Then, connect Storage Explorer to your storage account by following the steps in [Get started with Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md). To learn more, see [Quickstart: Create a blob in object storage with Azure Storage Explorer](../storage/blobs/quickstart-storage-explorer.md). <p>Or, in the Azure portal, select your storage account. From your storage account menu, select **Storage Explorer**. |
    |||

  * To add larger maps for the **Logic App (Consumption)** resource type, you can also use the [Azure Logic Apps REST API - Maps](/rest/api/logic/maps/createorupdate). However, for the **Logic App (Standard)** resource type, the Azure Logic Apps REST API is currently unavailable.

## Limits

* With **Logic App (Standard)**, no limits exist for map file sizes.

* With **Logic App (Consumption)**, limits exist for integration accounts and artifacts such as maps. For more information, review [Limits and configuration information for Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#integration-account-limits).

<a name="add-assembly"></a>

## Add referenced assemblies (Consumption resource only)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your Azure account credentials.

1. In the main Azure search box, enter `integration accounts`, and select **Integration accounts**.

1. Select the integration account where you want to add your assembly.

1. On your integration account's menu, select **Overview**. Under **Settings**, select **Assemblies**.

1. On the **Assemblies** pane toolbar, select **Add**.

Based on your assembly file's size, follow the steps for uploading an assembly that's either [up to 2 MB](#smaller-assembly) or [more than 2 MB but only up to 8 MB](#larger-assembly). For limits on assembly quantities in integration accounts, review [Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#artifact-number-limits).

> [!NOTE]
> If you change your assembly, you must also update your map whether or not the map has changes.

<a name="smaller-assembly"></a>

### Add assemblies up to 2 MB

1. Under **Add Assembly**, enter a name for your assembly. Keep **Small file** selected. Next to the **Assembly** box, select the folder icon. Find and select the assembly you're uploading.

   After you select the assembly, the **Assembly Name** property automatically shows the assembly's file name.

1. When you're ready, select **OK**.

   After your assembly file finishes uploading, the assembly appears in the **Assemblies** list. On your integration account's **Overview** pane, under **Artifacts**, your uploaded assembly also appears.

<a name="larger-assembly"></a>

### Add assemblies more than 2 MB

To add larger assemblies, you can upload your assembly to an Azure blob container in your Azure storage account. Your steps for adding assemblies differ based whether your blob container has public read access. So first, check whether or not your blob container has public read access by following these steps: [Set public access level for blob container](../vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs.md#set-the-public-access-level-for-a-blob-container)

#### Check container access level

1. Open Azure Storage Explorer. In the Explorer window, expand your Azure subscription if not already expanded.

1. Expand **Storage Accounts** > {*your-storage-account*} > **Blob Containers**. Select your blob container.

1. From your blob container's shortcut menu, select **Set Public Access Level**.

   * If your blob container has at least public access, select **Cancel**, and follow these steps later on this page: [Upload to containers with public access](#public-access-assemblies)

     ![Public access](media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-maps/azure-blob-container-public-access.png)

   * If your blob container doesn't have public access, select **Cancel**, and follow these steps later on this page: [Upload to containers without public access](#no-public-access-assemblies)

     ![No public access](media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-maps/azure-blob-container-no-public-access.png)

<a name="public-access-assemblies"></a>

#### Upload to containers with public access

1. Upload the assembly to your storage account. In the right-side window, select **Upload**.

1. After you finish uploading, select your uploaded assembly. On the toolbar, select **Copy URL** so that you copy the assembly's URL.

1. Return to the Azure portal where the **Add Assembly** pane is open. Enter a name for your assembly. Select **Large file (larger than 2 MB)**.

   The **Content URI** box now appears, rather than the **Assembly** box.

1. In the **Content URI** box, paste your assembly's URL. Finish adding your assembly.

   After your assembly finishes uploading, the assembly appears in the **Assemblies** list. On your integration account's **Overview** pane, under **Artifacts**, your uploaded assembly also appears.

<a name="no-public-access-assemblies"></a>

#### Upload to containers without public access

1. Upload the assembly to your storage account. In the right-side window, select **Upload**.

1. After you finish uploading, generate a shared access signature (SAS) for your assembly. From your assembly's shortcut menu, select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

1. In the **Shared Access Signature** pane, select **Generate container-level shared access signature URI** > **Create**. After the SAS URL gets generated, next to the **URL** box, select **Copy**.

1. Return to the Azure portal where the **Add Assembly** pane is open. Enter a name for your assembly. Select **Large file (larger than 2 MB)**.

   The **Content URI** box now appears, rather than the **Assembly** box.

1. In the **Content URI** box, paste the SAS URI that you previously generated. Finish adding your assembly.

After your assembly finishes uploading, the assembly appears in the **Assemblies** list. On your integration account's **Overview** page, under **Artifacts**, your uploaded assembly also appears.

<a name="create-maps"></a>

## Create maps

To create an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) document that you can use as a map, you can use Visual Studio 2015 or 2019 to create an integration project by using the [Enterprise Integration SDK](https://aka.ms/vsmapsandschemas). In this project, you can build an integration map file, which lets you visually map items between two XML schema files. After you build this project, you get an XSLT document. For limits on map quantities in integration accounts, review [Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#artifact-number-limits).

Your map must have the following attributes and a `CDATA` section that contains the call to the assembly code:

* `name` is the custom assembly name.

* `namespace` is the namespace in your assembly that includes the custom code.

The following example shows a map that references an assembly named `XslUtilitiesLib` and calls the `circumference` method from the assembly.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:user="urn:my-scripts">
<msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="user">
    <msxsl:assembly name="XsltHelperLib"/>
    <msxsl:using namespace="XsltHelpers"/>
    <![CDATA[public double circumference(int radius){ XsltHelper helper = new XsltHelper(); return helper.circumference(radius); }]]>
</msxsl:script>
<xsl:template match="data">
<circles>
    <xsl:for-each select="circle">
        <circle>
            <xsl:copy-of select="node()"/>
                <circumference>
                    <xsl:value-of select="user:circumference(radius)"/>
                </circumference>
        </circle>
    </xsl:for-each>
</circles>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

## Tools and capabilities for maps

* When you create a map using Visual Studio and the [Enterprise Integration SDK](https://aka.ms/vsmapsandschemas), you work with a graphical representation of the map, which shows all the relationships and links you create.

* You can make a direct data copy between the XML schemas that you use to create the map. The [Enterprise Integration SDK](https://aka.ms/vsmapsandschemas) for Visual Studio includes a mapper that makes this task as simple as drawing a line that connects the elements in the source XML schema with their counterparts in the target XML schema.

* Operations or functions for multiple maps are available, including string functions, date time functions, and so on.

* To add a sample XML message, you can use the map testing capability. With just one gesture, you can test the map you created, and review the generated output.
