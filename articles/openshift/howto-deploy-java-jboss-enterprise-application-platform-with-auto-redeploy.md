# Quickstart: Auto-redeploy JBoss EAP on Azure Red Hat OpenShift with Source-to-Image (S2I)

This article shows you how to quickly set up JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) and deploy an app with the Source-to-Image (S2I) feature. The Source-to-Image feature enables you to build container images from source code without having to write Dockerfiles. The article uses a sample application that you can fork from GitHub and deploy to Azure Red Hat OpenShift. The article also shows you how to set up a webhook in GitHub to trigger a new build in OpenShift every time you push a change to the repository.

This article uses the Azure Marketplace offer for JBoss EAP to accelerate your journey to ARO. The offer automatically provisions resources including an ARO cluster with a built-in OpenShift Container Registry (OCR), the JBoss EAP Operator, and optionally a container image including JBoss EAP and your application using Source-to-Image (S2I). To see the offer, visit the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/eap-aro-portal). If you prefer manual step-by-step guidance for running JBoss EAP on ARO that doesn't use the automation enabled by the offer, see [Deploy a Java application with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](/azure/developer/java/ee/jboss-eap-on-aro).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

- A Red Hat account with complete profile. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free developer subscription through the [Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals](https://developers.redhat.com/register).

- A local developer command line with a UNIX-like command environment - for example, Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux - and Azure CLI installed. To learn how to install the Azure CLI, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- An Azure identity that you use to sign in that has either the [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role and the [User Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role or the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) role in the current subscription. For an overview of Azure roles, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](../role-based-access-control/overview.md)

## Create a Microsoft Entra service principal

Use the following steps to create a service principal:

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Cloud Shell.
1. Create a service principal by using the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "sp-aro-s2i-$(date +%s)"
   ```

   This command produces output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   {
     "appId": <app-ID>,
     "displayName": <display-Name>,
     "password": <password>,
     "tenant": <tenant>
   }
   ```

1. Copy the value of the `appId` and `password` fields. You use these values later in the deployment process.

## Fork the repository on GitHub

Use the following steps to fork the sample repo:

1. Open the repository <https://github.com/redhat-mw-demos/eap-on-aro-helloworld> in your browser.
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
1. Copy the URL of the forked repository.
