# Azure Blob storage bindings for Azure Functions overview

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml) via [triggers and bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md). Integrating with Blob storage allows you to build functions that react to changes in blob data as well as read and write values.

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Run a function as blob storage data changes | [Trigger](./functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger.md) |
| Read blob storage data in a function | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-storage-blob-input.md) |
| Allow a function to write blob storage data |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-storage-blob-output.md) |

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

Functions run as C# script, which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

# [Extension 5.x and higher](#tab/extensionv5/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Storage.Blobs](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs). Learn more about how these new types are different from `WindowsAzure.Storage` and `Microsoft.Azure.Storage` and how to migrate to them from the [Azure.Storage.Blobs Migration Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/storage/Azure.Storage.Blobs/AzureStorageNetMigrationV12.md).

This extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage.Blobs NuGet package], version 5.x.

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage.Blobs --version 5.0.0
``` 

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note.md)]

# [Functions 2.x and higher](#tab/functionsv2/in-process)

Working with the trigger and bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage NuGet package, version 4.x]. The package is used for .NET class libraries while the extension bundle is used for all other application types.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/in-process)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-storage-sdk-version](../../includes/functions-storage-sdk-version.md)]

# [Extension 5.x and higher](#tab/extensionv5/isolated-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Storage.Blobs](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs). Learn more about how these new types are different from `WindowsAzure.Storage` and `Microsoft.Azure.Storage` and how to migrate to them from the [Azure.Storage.Blobs Migration Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/storage/Azure.Storage.Blobs/AzureStorageNetMigrationV12.md).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs NuGet package], version 5.x.

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs--version 5.0.0
``` 

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-isolated-worker-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-isolated-worker-tables-note.md)]

# [Functions 2.x and higher](#tab/functionsv2/isolated-process)

Add the extension to your project by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage NuGet package, version 4.x].

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/isolated-process)

Functions version 1.x doesn't support isolated process.

# [Extension 5.x and higher](#tab/extensionv5/csharp-script)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This extension version is available from the extension bundle v3 by adding the following lines in your `host.json` file:

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json-v3](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json-v3.md)]

To learn more, see [Update your extensions].

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-bundle-v3-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-bundle-v3-tables-note.md)]

# [Functions 2.x and higher](#tab/functionsv2/csharp-script)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x. 

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/csharp-script)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

## Install bundle

The Blob storage binding is part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the binding, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

# [Bundle v3.x](#tab/extensionv3)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

You can add this version of the extension from the extension bundle v3 by adding or replacing the following code in your `host.json` file:

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json-v3](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json-v3.md)]

To learn more, see [Update your extensions].

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-bundle-v3-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-bundle-v3-tables-note.md)]

# [Bundle v2.x](#tab/extensionv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functions1)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the extension.

## host.json settings

This section describes the function app configuration settings available for functions that use this binding. These settings only apply when using extension version 5.0.0 and higher. The example host.json file below contains only the version 2.x+ settings for this binding. For more information about function app configuration settings in versions 2.x and later versions, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This section doesn't apply to extension versions before 5.0.0. For those earlier versions, there aren't any function app-wide configuration settings for blobs.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "extensions": {
        "blobs": {
            "maxDegreeOfParallelism": 4
        }
    }
}
```

|Property  |Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|maxDegreeOfParallelism|8 * (the number of available cores)|The integer number of concurrent invocations allowed for each blob-triggered function. The minimum allowed value is 1.|
