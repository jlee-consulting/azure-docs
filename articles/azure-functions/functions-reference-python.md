# Azure Functions Python developer guide

This article is an introduction to developing for Azure Functions by using Python. It assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developer guide](functions-reference.md).

As a Python developer, you might also be interested in one of the following articles:

> [!NOTE]
> Although you can [develop your Python-based functions locally on Windows](create-first-function-vs-code-python.md#run-the-function-locally), Python functions are supported in Azure only when they're running on Linux. See the [list of supported operating system/runtime combinations](functions-scale.md#operating-systemruntime).

## Programming model

Azure Functions expects a function to be a stateless method in your Python script that processes input and produces output. By default, the runtime expects the method to be implemented as a global method called `main()` in the *\__init\__.py* file. You can also [specify an alternate entry point](#alternate-entry-point).

Data from triggers and bindings is bound to the function via method attributes that use the `name` property defined in the *function.json* file. For example, the  following _function.json_ file describes a simple function triggered by an HTTP request named `req`:

:::code language="json" source="~/functions-quickstart-templates/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python/function.json":::

Based on this definition, the *\__init\__.py* file that contains the function code might look like the following example:

```python
def main(req):
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```

You can also explicitly declare the attribute types and return type in the function by using Python type annotations. This action helps you to use the IntelliSense and autocomplete features that many Python code editors provide.

```python
import azure.functions


def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest) -> str:
    user = req.params.get('user')
    return f'Hello, {user}!'
```

Use the Python annotations included in the [azure.functions.*](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions) package to bind inputs and outputs to your methods.

## Alternate entry point

You can change the default behavior of a function by optionally specifying the `scriptFile` and `entryPoint` properties in the *function.json* file. For example, the following _function.json_ file tells the runtime to use the `customentry()` method in the _main.py_ file as the entry point for your function:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "main.py",
  "entryPoint": "customentry",
  "bindings": [
      ...
  ]
}
```

## Folder structure

The recommended folder structure for an Azure Functions project in Python looks like the following example:

```
 <project_root>/
 | - .venv/
 | - .vscode/
 | - my_first_function/
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | | - example.py
 | - my_second_function/
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - function.json
 | - shared_code/
 | | - __init__.py
 | | - my_first_helper_function.py
 | | - my_second_helper_function.py
 | - tests/
 | | - test_my_second_function.py
 | - .funcignore
 | - host.json
 | - local.settings.json
 | - requirements.txt
 | - Dockerfile
```
The main project folder (*<project_root>*) can contain the following files:

* *local.settings.json*: Used to store app settings and connection strings when functions are running locally. This file isn't published to Azure. To learn more, see [Local settings file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).
* *requirements.txt*: Contains the list of Python packages that the system installs when you're publishing to Azure.
* *host.json*: Contains configuration options that affect all functions in a function app instance. This file is published to Azure. Not all options are supported when functions are running locally. To learn more, see the [host.json reference](functions-host-json.md).
* *.vscode/*: (Optional) Contains stored Visual Studio Code configurations. To learn more, see [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).
* *.venv/*: (Optional) Contains a Python virtual environment that's used for local development.
* *Dockerfile*: (Optional) Used when you're publishing your project in a [custom container](functions-create-function-linux-custom-image.md).
* *tests/*: (Optional) Contains the test cases of your function app.
* *.funcignore*: (Optional) Declares files that shouldn't be published to Azure. Usually, this file contains `.vscode/` to ignore your editor setting, `.venv/` to ignore the local Python virtual environment, `tests/` to ignore test cases, and `local.settings.json` to prevent local app settings from being published.

Each function has its own code file and binding configuration file (*function.json*).

When you deploy your project to a function app in Azure, the entire contents of the main project (*<project_root>*) folder should be included in the package, but not the folder itself. That means *host.json* should be in the package root. We recommend that you maintain your tests in a folder along with other functions. In this example, the folder is *tests/*. For more information, see [Unit testing](#unit-testing).

## Import behavior

You can import modules in your function code by using both absolute and relative references. Based on the folder structure shown earlier, the following imports work from within the function file *<project_root>\my\_first\_function\\_\_init\_\_.py*:

```python
from shared_code import my_first_helper_function #(absolute)
```

```python
import shared_code.my_second_helper_function #(absolute)
```

```python
from . import example #(relative)
```

> [!NOTE]
>  The *shared_code/* folder needs to contain an *\_\_init\_\_.py* file to mark it as a Python package when you're using absolute import syntax.

The following *\_\_app\_\_* import and beyond top-level relative import are deprecated. The static type checker and the Python test frameworks don't support them.

```python
from __app__.shared_code import my_first_helper_function #(deprecated __app__ import)
```

```python
from ..shared_code import my_first_helper_function #(deprecated beyond top-level relative import)
```

## Triggers and inputs

Inputs are divided into two categories in Azure Functions: trigger input and other binding input. Although they're different in the *function.json* file, usage is identical in Python code. When functions are running locally, connection strings or secrets required by trigger and input sources are maintained in the `Values` collection of the *local.settings.json* file. When functions are running in Azure, those same connection strings or secrets are stored securely as [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).

The following example code demonstrates the difference between the two:

```json
// function.json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "route": "items/{id}"
    },
    {
      "name": "obj",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "blob",
      "path": "samples/{id}",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// local.settings.json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "<azure-storage-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

```python
# __init__.py
import azure.functions as func
import logging


def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         obj: func.InputStream):

    logging.info(f'Python HTTP triggered function processed: {obj.read()}')
```

When the function is invoked, the HTTP request is passed to the function as `req`. An entry will be retrieved from Azure Blob Storage based on the ID in the route URL and made available as `obj` in the function body.  Here, the storage account specified is the connection string found in the `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting, which is the same storage account that the function app uses.

## Outputs

Output can be expressed in the return value and in output parameters. If there's only one output, we recommend using the return value. For multiple outputs, you'll have to use output parameters.

To use the return value of a function as the value of an output binding, set the `name` property of the binding to `$return` in *function.json*.

To produce multiple outputs, use the `set()` method provided by the [azure.functions.Out](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out) interface to assign a value to the binding. For example, the following function can push a message to a queue and return an HTTP response:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "req",
      "direction": "in",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "authLevel": "anonymous"
    },
    {
      "name": "msg",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "queue",
      "queueName": "outqueue",
      "connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "direction": "out",
      "type": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

```python
import azure.functions as func


def main(req: func.HttpRequest,
         msg: func.Out[func.QueueMessage]) -> str:

    message = req.params.get('body')
    msg.set(message)
    return message
```

## Logging

Access to the Azure Functions runtime logger is available via a root [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-logging) handler in your function app. This logger is tied to Application Insights and allows you to flag warnings and errors that occur during the function execution.

The following example logs an info message when the function is invoked via an HTTP trigger:

```python
import logging


def main(req):
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```

More logging methods are available that let you write to the console at different trace levels:

| Method                 | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `critical(_message_)`   | Writes a message with level CRITICAL on the root logger.  |
| `error(_message_)`   | Writes a message with level ERROR on the root logger.    |
| `warning(_message_)`    | Writes a message with level WARNING on the root logger.  |
| `info(_message_)`    | Writes a message with level INFO on the root logger.  |
| `debug(_message_)` | Writes a message with level DEBUG on the root logger.  |

To learn more about logging, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md).

### Log custom telemetry

By default, the Azure Functions runtime collects logs and other telemetry data that your functions generate. This telemetry ends up as traces in Application Insights. By default, [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings.md#supported-bindings) also collect request and dependency telemetry for certain Azure services. 

To collect custom request and custom dependency telemetry outside bindings, you can use the [OpenCensus Python Extensions](https://github.com/census-ecosystem/opencensus-python-extensions-azure). The Azure Functions extension sends custom telemetry data to your Application Insights instance. You can find a list of supported extensions at the [OpenCensus repository](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/tree/master/contrib).

>[!NOTE]
>To use the OpenCensus Python extensions, you need to enable [Python worker extensions](#python-worker-extensions) in your function app by setting `PYTHON_ENABLE_WORKER_EXTENSIONS` to `1`. You also need to switch to using the Application Insights connection string by adding the [`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`](functions-app-settings.md#applicationinsights_connection_string) setting to your [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings), if it's not already there.


```
// requirements.txt
...
opencensus-extension-azure-functions
opencensus-ext-requests
```

```python
import json
import logging

import requests
from opencensus.extension.azure.functions import OpenCensusExtension
from opencensus.trace import config_integration

config_integration.trace_integrations(['requests'])

OpenCensusExtension.configure()

def main(req, context):
    logging.info('Executing HttpTrigger with OpenCensus extension')

    # You must use context.tracer to create spans
    with context.tracer.span("parent"):
        response = requests.get(url='http://example.com')

    return json.dumps({
        'method': req.method,
        'response': response.status_code,
        'ctx_func_name': context.function_name,
        'ctx_func_dir': context.function_directory,
        'ctx_invocation_id': context.invocation_id,
        'ctx_trace_context_Traceparent': context.trace_context.Traceparent,
        'ctx_trace_context_Tracestate': context.trace_context.Tracestate,
        'ctx_retry_context_RetryCount': context.retry_context.retry_count,
        'ctx_retry_context_MaxRetryCount': context.retry_context.max_retry_count,
    })
```

## HTTP trigger and bindings

The HTTP trigger is defined in the *function.json* file. The `name` parameter of the binding must match the named parameter in the function.

The previous examples use the binding name `req`. This parameter is an [HttpRequest] object, and an [HttpResponse] object is returned.

From the `HttpRequest` object, you can get request headers, query parameters, route parameters, and the message body.

The following example is from the [HTTP trigger template for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-templates/tree/dev/Functions.Templates/Templates/HttpTrigger-Python):

```python
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    headers = {"my-http-header": "some-value"}

    name = req.params.get('name')
    if not name:
        try:
            req_body = req.get_json()
        except ValueError:
            pass
        else:
            name = req_body.get('name')

    if name:
        return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello {name}!", headers=headers)
    else:
        return func.HttpResponse(
             "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body",
             headers=headers, status_code=400
        )
```

In this function, the value of the `name` query parameter is obtained from the `params` parameter of the `HttpRequest` object. The JSON-encoded message body is read using the `get_json` method.

Likewise, you can set the `status_code` and `headers` information for the response message in the returned `HttpResponse` object.

## Web frameworks

You can use WSGI and ASGI-compatible frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI with your HTTP-triggered Python functions. This section shows how to modify your functions to support these frameworks.

First, the *function.json* file must be updated to include `route` in the HTTP trigger, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "bindings": [
    {
       "authLevel": "anonymous",
       "type": "httpTrigger",
       "direction": "in",
       "name": "req",
       "methods": [
           "get",
           "post"
       ],
       "route": "{*route}"
    },
    {
       "type": "http",
       "direction": "out",
       "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

The *host.json* file must also be updated to include an HTTP `routePrefix` value, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "logging": 
  {
    "applicationInsights": 
    {
      "samplingSettings": 
      {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "excludedTypes": "Request"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensionBundle": 
  {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
    "version": "[2.*, 3.0.0)"
  },
  "extensions": 
  {
    "http": 
    {
        "routePrefix": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Update the Python code file *init.py*, based on the interface that your framework uses. The following example shows either an ASGI handler approach or a WSGI wrapper approach for Flask:

# [ASGI](#tab/asgi)

```python
app=fastapi.FastAPI()

@app.get("hello/{name}")
async def get_name(
  name: str,):
  return {
      "name": name,}

def main(req: func.HttpRequest, context: func.Context) -> func.HttpResponse:
    return AsgiMiddleware(app).handle(req, context)
```

# [WSGI](#tab/wsgi)

```python
app=Flask("Test")

@app.route("hello/<name>", methods=['GET'])
def hello(name: str):
    return f"hello {name}"

def main(req: func.HttpRequest, context) -> func.HttpResponse:
  logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
  return func.WsgiMiddleware(app).handle(req, context)
```
For a full example, see [Using the Flask framework with Azure Functions](/samples/azure-samples/flask-app-on-azure-functions/azure-functions-python-create-flask-app/).

## Scaling and performance

For scaling and performance best practices for Python function apps, see [Improve throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions](python-scale-performance-reference.md).

## Context

To get the invocation context of a function during execution, include the [`context`](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.context) argument in its signature.

For example:

```python
import azure.functions


def main(req: azure.functions.HttpRequest,
         context: azure.functions.Context) -> str:
    return f'{context.invocation_id}'
```

The [Context](/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.context) class has the following string attributes:

- `function_directory`: Directory in which the function is running.

- `function_name`: Name of the function.

- `invocation_id`: ID of the current function invocation.

- `trace_context`: Context for distributed tracing. For more information, see [Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) on the W3C website.

- `retry_context`: Context for retries to the function. For more information, see [Retry policies](./functions-bindings-errors.md#retry-policies).

## Global variables

It isn't guaranteed that the state of your app will be preserved for future executions. However, the Azure Functions runtime often reuses the same process for multiple executions of the same app. To cache the results of an expensive computation, declare it as a global variable:

```python
CACHED_DATA = None


def main(req):
    global CACHED_DATA
    if CACHED_DATA is None:
        CACHED_DATA = load_json()

    # ... use CACHED_DATA in code
```

## Environment variables

In Azure Functions, [application settings](functions-app-settings.md), such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. There are two main ways to access these settings in your code: 

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `os.environ["myAppSetting"]` | Tries to get the application setting by key name. It raises an error when unsuccessful.  |
| `os.getenv("myAppSetting")` | Tries to get the application setting by key name. It returns `null` when unsuccessful.  |

Both of these ways require you to declare `import os`.

The following example uses `os.environ["myAppSetting"]` to get the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings), with the key named `myAppSetting`:

```python
import logging
import os
import azure.functions as func

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:

    # Get the setting named 'myAppSetting'
    my_app_setting_value = os.environ["myAppSetting"]
    logging.info(f'My app setting value:{my_app_setting_value}')
```

For local development, application settings are [maintained in the local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).

## Python version

Azure Functions supports the following Python versions. These are official Python distributions.

| Functions version | Python versions |
| ----- | ----- |
| 4.x | 3.9<br/> 3.8<br/>3.7 |
| 3.x | 3.9<br/> 3.8<br/>3.7<br/>3.6 |
| 2.x | 3.7<br/>3.6 |

To request a specific Python version when you create your function app in Azure, use the `--runtime-version` option of the [`az functionapp create`](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. The `--functions-version` option sets the Azure Functions runtime version. 

### Changing Python version

To set a Python function app to a specific language version, you need to specify the language and the version of the language in `linuxFxVersion` field in site configuration. For example, to change Python app to use Python 3.8, set `linuxFxVersion` to `python|3.8`.

To learn more about the Azure Functions runtime support policy, see [Language runtime support policy](./language-support-policy.md).

You can view and set `linuxFxVersion` from the Azure CLI by using the [az functionapp config show](/cli/azure/functionapp/config) command. Replace `<function_app>` with the name of your function app. Replace `<my_resource_group>` with the name of the resource group for your function app.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config show --name <function_app> \
--resource-group <my_resource_group>
```

You see `linuxFxVersion` in the following output, which has been truncated for clarity:

```output
{
  ...
  "kind": null,
  "limits": null,
  "linuxFxVersion": <LINUX_FX_VERSION>,
  "loadBalancing": "LeastRequests",
  "localMySqlEnabled": false,
  "location": "West US",
  "logsDirectorySizeLimit": 35,
   ...
}
```

You can update the `linuxFxVersion` setting in the function app by using the [az functionapp config set](/cli/azure/functionapp/config) command. In the following code: 

- Replace `<FUNCTION_APP>` with the name of your function app. 
- Replace `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` with the name of the resource group for your function app. 
- Replace `<LINUX_FX_VERSION>` with the Python version that you want to use, prefixed by `python|`. For example: `python|3.9`.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config set --name <FUNCTION_APP> \
--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
--linux-fx-version <LINUX_FX_VERSION>
```

You can run the command from [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md) by selecting **Try it** in the preceding code sample. You can also use the [Azure CLI locally](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run the command after you use [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) to sign in.

The function app restarts after you change the site configuration.

### Local Python version 

When running locally, the Azure Functions Core Tools uses the available Python version.

## Package management

When you're developing locally by using the Azure Functions Core Tools or Visual Studio Code, add the names and versions of the required packages to the *requirements.txt* file and install them by using `pip`.

For example, you can use the following requirements file and `pip` command to install the `requests` package from PyPI:

```txt
requests==2.19.1
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Publishing to Azure

When you're ready to publish, make sure that all your publicly available dependencies are listed in the *requirements.txt* file. This file is at the root of your project directory.

You can also find project files and folders that are excluded from publishing, including the virtual environment folder, in the root directory of your project.

Three build actions are supported for publishing your Python project to Azure: remote build, local build, and builds that use custom dependencies.

You can also use Azure Pipelines to build your dependencies and publish by using continuous delivery (CD). To learn more, see [Continuous delivery by using Azure DevOps](functions-how-to-azure-devops.md).

### Remote build

When you use a remote build, dependencies restored on the server and native dependencies match the production environment. This results in a smaller deployment package to upload. Use a remote build when you're developing Python apps on Windows. If your project has custom dependencies, you can [use a remote build with an extra index URL](#remote-build-with-extra-index-url).

Dependencies are obtained remotely based on the contents of the *requirements.txt* file. [Remote build](functions-deployment-technologies.md#remote-build) is the recommended build method. By default, Azure Functions Core Tools requests a remote build when you use the following [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#publish) command to publish your Python project to Azure. Replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure.

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```

The [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code](./create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md#publish-the-project-to-azure) also requests a remote build by default.

### Local build

Dependencies are obtained locally based on the contents of the *requirements.txt* file. You can prevent a remote build by using the following [func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local.md#publish) command to publish with a local build. Replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure.

```command
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME> --build local
```

When you use the `--build local` option, project dependencies are read from the *requirements.txt* file. Those dependent packages are downloaded and installed locally. Project files and dependencies are deployed from your local computer to Azure. This results in the upload of a larger deployment package to Azure. If you can't get the *requirements.txt* file by using Core Tools, you must use the custom dependencies option for publishing.

We don't recommend using local builds when you're developing locally on Windows.

### Custom dependencies

When your project has dependencies not found in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), there are two ways to build the project.

#### Remote build with extra index URL

When your packages are available from an accessible custom package index, use a remote build. Before publishing, make sure to [create an app setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings) named `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`. The value for this setting is the URL of your custom package index. Using this setting tells the remote build to run `pip install` with the `--extra-index-url` option. To learn more, see the [Python pip install documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format).

You can also use basic authentication credentials with your extra package index URLs. To learn more, see [Basic authentication credentials](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#basic-authentication-credentials) in Python documentation.

#### Installing local packages

If your project uses packages that aren't publicly available, you can make them available to your app by putting them in the *\_\_app\_\_/.python_packages* directory. Before publishing, run the following command to install the dependencies locally:

```command
pip install  --target="<PROJECT_DIR>/.python_packages/lib/site-packages"  -r requirements.txt
```

When you're using custom dependencies, use the following `--no-build` publishing option because you've already installed the dependencies into the project folder. Replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app in Azure.

```command
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME> --no-build
```

## Unit testing

You can test functions written in Python the same way that you test other Python code: through standard testing frameworks. For most bindings, it's possible to create a mock input object by creating an instance of an appropriate class from the [azure.functions](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions/) package. Because the `azure.functions` package isn't immediately available, be sure to install it via your *requirements.txt* file as described in the earlier [Package management](#package-management) section.

Take *my_second_function* as an example. Following is a mock test of an HTTP triggered function.

First, to create the *<project_root>/my_second_function/function.json* file and define this function as an HTTP trigger, use the following code:

```json
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "entryPoint": "main",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, you can implement *my_second_function* and *shared_code.my_second_helper_function*:

```python
# <project_root>/my_second_function/__init__.py
import azure.functions as func
import logging

# Use absolute import to resolve shared_code modules
from shared_code import my_second_helper_function

# Define an HTTP trigger that accepts the ?value=<int> query parameter
# Double the value and return the result in HttpResponse
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Executing my_second_function.')

    initial_value: int = int(req.params.get('value'))
    doubled_value: int = my_second_helper_function.double(initial_value)

    return func.HttpResponse(
      body=f"{initial_value} * 2 = {doubled_value}",
      status_code=200
    )
```

```python
# <project_root>/shared_code/__init__.py
# Empty __init__.py file marks shared_code folder as a Python package
```

```python
# <project_root>/shared_code/my_second_helper_function.py

def double(value: int) -> int:
  return value * 2
```

You can start writing test cases for your HTTP trigger:

```python
# <project_root>/tests/test_my_second_function.py
import unittest

import azure.functions as func
from my_second_function import main

class TestFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_my_second_function(self):
        # Construct a mock HTTP request.
        req = func.HttpRequest(
            method='GET',
            body=None,
            url='/api/my_second_function',
            params={'value': '21'})

        # Call the function.
        resp = main(req)

        # Check the output.
        self.assertEqual(
            resp.get_body(),
            b'21 * 2 = 42',
        )
```

Inside your *.venv* Python virtual environment, install your favorite Python test framework, such as `pip install pytest`. Then run `pytest tests` to check the test result.

## Temporary files

The `tempfile.gettempdir()` method returns a temporary folder, which on Linux is */tmp*. Your application can use this directory to store temporary files that your functions generate and use during execution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Files written to the temporary directory aren't guaranteed to persist across invocations. During scale-out, temporary files aren't shared between instances.

The following example creates a named temporary file in the temporary directory (*/tmp*):

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import tempfile
from os import listdir

#---
   tempFilePath = tempfile.gettempdir()
   fp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
   fp.write(b'Hello world!')
   filesDirListInTemp = listdir(tempFilePath)
```

We recommend that you maintain your tests in a folder that's separate from the project folder. This action keeps you from deploying test code with your app.

## Preinstalled libraries

A few libraries come with the runtime for Azure Functions on Python.

### Python Standard Library

The Python Standard Library contains a list of built-in Python modules that are shipped with each Python distribution. Most of these libraries help you access system functionality, like file I/O. On Windows systems, these libraries are installed with Python. On Unix systems, package collections provide them.

To view the full details of these libraries, use these links:

* [Python 3.6 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/)
* [Python 3.7 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/)
* [Python 3.8 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/)
* [Python 3.9 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/)

### Worker dependencies

The Python worker for Azure Functions requires a specific set of libraries. You can also use these libraries in your functions, but they aren't a part of the Python standard. If your functions rely on any of these libraries, they might not be available to your code when you're running outside Azure Functions. You can find a detailed list of dependencies in the `install\_requires` section in the [setup.py](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/blob/dev/setup.py#L282) file.

> [!NOTE]
> If your function app's *requirements.txt* file contains an `azure-functions-worker` entry, remove it. The Azure Functions platform automatically manages this worker, and we regularly update it with new features and bug fixes. Manually installing an old version of the worker in *requirements.txt* might cause unexpected problems.

> [!NOTE]
> If your package contains certain libraries that might collide with the worker's dependencies (for example, protobuf, TensorFlow, or grpcio), configure [PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES](functions-app-settings.md#python_isolate_worker_dependencies-preview) to `1` in app settings to prevent your application from referring to the worker's dependencies. This feature is in preview.

### Python library for Azure Functions

Every Python worker update includes a new version of the [Python library for Azure Functions (azure.functions)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-library). This approach makes it easier to continuously update your Python function apps, because each update is backward compatible. You can find a list of releases of this library in the [azure-functions information on the PyPi website](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions/#history).

The runtime library version is fixed by Azure, and *requirements.txt* can't override it. The `azure-functions` entry in *requirements.txt* is only for linting and customer awareness.

Use the following code to track the version of the Python library for Azure Functions in your runtime:

```python
getattr(azure.functions, '__version__', '< 1.2.1')
```

### Runtime system libraries

The following table lists preinstalled system libraries in Docker images for the Python worker:

|  Functions runtime  | Debian version | Python versions |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Version 2.x | Stretch  | [Python 3.7](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-docker/blob/dev/host/4/bullseye/amd64/python/python37/python37.Dockerfile) |
| Version 3.x | Buster | [Python 3.6](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-docker/blob/master/host/3.0/buster/amd64/python/python36/python36.Dockerfile)<br/>[Python 3.7](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-docker/blob/master/host/3.0/buster/amd64/python/python37/python37.Dockerfile)<br />[Python 3.8](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-docker/blob/master/host/3.0/buster/amd64/python/python38/python38.Dockerfile)<br/> [Python 3.9](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-docker/blob/master/host/3.0/buster/amd64/python/python39/python39.Dockerfile)|

## Python worker extensions  

The Python worker process that runs in Azure Functions lets you integrate third-party libraries into your function app. These extension libraries act as middleware that can inject specific operations during the lifecycle of your function's execution. 

Extensions are imported in your function code much like a standard Python library module. Extensions are executed based on the following scopes: 

| Scope | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Application level** | When the extension is imported into any function trigger, it applies to every function execution in the app. |
| **Function level** | Execution is limited to only the specific function trigger into which it's imported. |

Review the information for an extension to learn more about the scope in which the extension runs. 

Extensions implement a Python worker extension interface. This action lets the Python worker process call into the extension code during the function execution lifecycle.

### Using extensions 

You can use a Python worker extension library in your Python functions by following these basic steps:

1. Add the extension package in the *requirements.txt* file for your project.
1. Install the library into your app.
1. Add the application setting `PYTHON_ENABLE_WORKER_EXTENSIONS`:
    + To add the setting locally, add `"PYTHON_ENABLE_WORKER_EXTENSIONS": "1"` in the `Values` section of your [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).
    + To add the setting in Azure, add `PYTHON_ENABLE_WORKER_EXTENSIONS=1` to your [app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings).
1. Import the extension module into your function trigger. 
1. Configure the extension instance, if needed. Configuration requirements should be called out in the extension's documentation. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft doesn't support or warranty third-party Python worker extension libraries. Make sure that any extensions you use in your function app are trustworthy. You bear the full risk of using a malicious or poorly written extension. 

Third parties should provide specific documentation on how to install and consume their specific extension in your function app. For a basic example of how to consume an extension, see [Consuming your extension](develop-python-worker-extensions.md#consume-your-extension-locally). 

Here are examples of using extensions in a function app, by scope:

# [Application level](#tab/application-level)

```python
# <project_root>/requirements.txt
application-level-extension==1.0.0
```

```python
# <project_root>/Trigger/__init__.py

from application_level_extension import AppExtension
AppExtension.configure(key=value)

def main(req, context):
  # Use context.app_ext_attributes here
```
# [Function level](#tab/function-level)
```python
# <project_root>/requirements.txt
function-level-extension==1.0.0
```

```python

# <project_root>/Trigger/__init__.py

from function_level_extension import FuncExtension
func_ext_instance = FuncExtension(__file__)

def main(req, context):
  # Use func_ext_instance.attributes here
```
---

### Creating extensions 

Extensions are created by third-party library developers who have created functionality that can be integrated into Azure Functions. An extension developer designs, implements, and releases Python packages that contain custom logic designed specifically to be run in the context of function execution. These extensions can be published either to the PyPI registry or to GitHub repositories.

To learn how to create, package, publish, and consume a Python worker extension package, see [Develop Python worker extensions for Azure Functions](develop-python-worker-extensions.md).

#### Application-level extensions

An extension inherited from [`AppExtensionBase`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-library/blob/dev/azure/functions/extension/app_extension_base.py) runs in an _application_ scope. 

`AppExtensionBase` exposes the following abstract class methods for you to implement:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Called after the extension is imported. |
| `configure` | Called from function code when it's needed to configure the extension. |
| `post_function_load_app_level` | Called right after the function is loaded. The function name and function directory are passed to the extension. Keep in mind that the function directory is read-only. Any attempt to write to a local file in this directory fails. |
| `pre_invocation_app_level` | Called right before the function is triggered. The function context and function invocation arguments are passed to the extension. You can usually pass other attributes in the context object for the function code to consume. |
| `post_invocation_app_level` | Called right after the function execution finishes. The function context, function invocation arguments, and invocation return object are passed to the extension. This implementation is a good place to validate whether execution of the lifecycle hooks succeeded. |

#### Function-level extensions

An extension that inherits from [FuncExtensionBase](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-library/blob/dev/azure/functions/extension/func_extension_base.py) runs in a specific function trigger. 

`FuncExtensionBase` exposes the following abstract class methods for implementations:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__` | Called when an extension instance is initialized in a specific function. This method is the constructor of the extension. When you're implementing this abstract method, you might want to accept a `filename` parameter and pass it to the parent's `super().__init__(filename)` method for proper extension registration. |
| `post_function_load` | Called right after the function is loaded. The function name and function directory are passed to the extension. Keep in mind that the function directory is read-only. Any attempt to write to a local file in this directory fails. |
| `pre_invocation` | Called right before the function is triggered. The function context and function invocation arguments are passed to the extension. You can usually pass other attributes in the context object for the function code to consume. |
| `post_invocation` | Called right after the function execution finishes. The function context, function invocation arguments, and invocation return object are passed to the extension. This implementation is a good place to validate whether execution of the lifecycle hooks succeeded. |

## Cross-origin resource sharing

[!INCLUDE [functions-cors](../../includes/functions-cors.md)]

CORS is fully supported for Python function apps.

## Async

By default, a host instance for Python can process only one function invocation at a time. This is because Python is a single-threaded runtime. For a function app that processes a large number of I/O events or is being I/O bound, you can significantly improve performance by running functions asynchronously. For more information, see [Improve throughout performance of Python apps in Azure Functions](python-scale-performance-reference.md#async).

## <a name="shared-memory"></a>Shared memory (preview)

To improve throughput, Azure Functions lets your out-of-process Python language worker share memory with the host process. When your function app is hitting bottlenecks, you can enable shared memory by adding an application setting named [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_SHARED_MEMORY_DATA_TRANSFER_ENABLED](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_shared_memory_data_transfer_enabled) with a value of `1`. With shared memory enabled, you can then use the [DOCKER_SHM_SIZE](functions-app-settings.md#docker_shm_size) setting to set the shared memory to something like `268435456`, which is equivalent to 256 MB.

For example, you might enable shared memory to reduce bottlenecks when using Azure Blob Storage bindings to transfer payloads larger than 1 MB.

This functionality is available only for function apps running in Premium and Dedicated (Azure App Service) plans. To learn more, see [Shared memory](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/wiki/Shared-Memory).
