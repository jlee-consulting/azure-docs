# Register Azure Functions binding extensions

Starting with Azure Functions version 2.x, [bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md) are available as separate packages from the functions runtime. While .NET functions access bindings through NuGet packages, extension bundles allow other functions access to all bindings through a configuration setting.

Consider the following items related to binding extensions:

- Binding extensions aren't explicitly registered in Functions 1.x except when [creating a C# class library using Visual Studio](#local-csharp).

- HTTP and timer triggers are supported by default and don't require an extension.

The following table indicates when and how you register bindings.

| Development environment |Registration<br/> in Functions 1.x  |Registration<br/> in Functions 3.x/2.x  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Azure portal|Automatic|Automatic<sup>*</sup>|
|Non-.NET languages or local Azure Core Tools development|Automatic|[Use Azure Functions Core Tools and extension bundles](#extension-bundles)|
|C# class library using Visual Studio|[Use NuGet tools](#vs)|[Use NuGet tools](#vs)|
|C# class library using Visual Studio Code|N/A|[Use .NET Core CLI](#vs-code)|

<sup>*</sup> Portal uses extension bundles.

## <a name="extension-bundles"></a>Extension bundles

Extension bundles is way to add a compatible set of Functions binding extensions to your function app. When using bundles, a predefined set of extensions are added when you build your app. Extension packages defined in a bundle are verified to be compatible with each other, which helps you avoid conflicts between packages. Extension bundles allows you to avoid having to publish .NET project code with a non-.NET functions project. You enable extension bundles in the app's host.json file.  

You can use extension bundles with version 2.x and later versions of the Functions runtime. 

Use extension bundles for local development using Azure Functions Core Tools, Visual Studio Code, and when you build remotely. When developing locally, make sure you are using the latest version of [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#v2). Extension bundles are also used when developing functions in the Azure portal. 

If you don't use extension bundles, you must install the .NET Core 2.x SDK on your local computer before you [explicitly install any binding extensions](#explicitly-install-extensions). An extensions.csproj file, which explicitly defines the required extensions, is added to your project. Extension bundles removes these requirements for local development. 

To use extension bundles, update the *host.json* file to include the following entry for `extensionBundle`:
 
[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json.md)]

## Explicitly install extensions

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-register-core-tools](../../includes/functions-extension-register-core-tools.md)]

## <a name="local-csharp"></a>NuGet packages

For a C# class library-based functions project, you should install Extension bundles is designed specifically for projects that aren't class 

### <a name="vs"></a> C\# class library with Visual Studio

In **Visual Studio**, you can install packages from the Package Manager Console using the [Install-Package](/nuget/tools/ps-ref-install-package) command, as shown in the following example:

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus -Version <TARGET_VERSION>
```

The name of the package used for a given binding is provided in the reference article for that binding. For an example, see the [Packages section of the Service Bus binding reference article](functions-bindings-service-bus.md#functions-1x).

Replace `<TARGET_VERSION>` in the example with a specific version of the package, such as `3.0.0-beta5`. Valid versions are listed on the individual package pages at [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The major versions that correspond to Functions runtime 1.x or 2.x are specified in the reference article for the binding.

If you use `Install-Package` to reference a binding, you don't need to use [extension bundles](#extension-bundles). This approach is specific for class libraries built in Visual Studio.

## <a name="vs-code"></a> C# class library with Visual Studio Code

In **Visual Studio Code**, install packages for a C# class library project from the command prompt using the [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command in the .NET Core CLI. The following example demonstrates how you add a  binding:

```terminal
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.<BINDING_TYPE_NAME> --version <TARGET_VERSION>
```

The .NET Core CLI can only be used for Azure Functions 2.x development.

Replace `<BINDING_TYPE_NAME>` with the name of the package that contains the binding you need. You can find the desired binding reference article in the [list of supported bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md#supported-bindings).

Replace `<TARGET_VERSION>` in the example with a specific version of the package, such as `3.0.0-beta5`. Valid versions are listed on the individual package pages at [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The major versions that correspond to Functions runtime 1.x or 2.x are specified in the reference article for the binding.
