# Azure Cosmos DB trigger and bindings for Azure Functions 2.x and higher overview

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of the Azure Functions runtime you are using: "]
> * [Version 1](functions-bindings-cosmosdb.md)
> * [Version 2 and higher](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2.md)

This set of articles explains how to work with [Azure Cosmos DB](../cosmos-db/serverless-computing-database.md) bindings in Azure Functions 2.x and higher. Azure Functions supports trigger, input, and output bindings for Azure Cosmos DB.

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Run a function when an Azure Cosmos DB document is created or modified | [Trigger](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger.md) |
| Read an Azure Cosmos DB document | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input.md) |
| Save changes to an Azure Cosmos DB document  |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> This reference is for [Azure Functions version 2.x and higher](functions-versions.md).  For information about how to use these bindings in Functions 1.x, see [Azure Cosmos DB bindings for Azure Functions 1.x](functions-bindings-cosmosdb.md).
>
> This binding was originally named DocumentDB. In Functions version 2.x and higher, the trigger, bindings, and package are all named Cosmos DB.

## Supported APIs

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running functions on .NET 5.0 in Azure](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

Functions run as C# script, which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

---

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/in-process)

Working with the trigger and bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB), version 3.x.

# [Extension 4.x+ (preview)](#tab/extensionv4/in-process)

This preview version of the Cosmos DB bindings extension introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md). 

This version also changes the types that you can bind to, replacing the types from the v2 SDK `Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB` with newer types from the v3 SDK [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos](../cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-dotnet-standard.md). Learn more about how these new types are different and how to migrate to them from the [SDK migration guide](../cosmos-db/sql/migrate-dotnet-v3.md), [trigger](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger.md), [input binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input.md), and [output binding](./functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output.md) examples.

This extension version is available as a [preview NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB/4.0.0-preview3).

> [!NOTE]
> Authentication with an identity instead of a secret using the 4.x preview extension is currently only available for Elastic Premium plans.

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/isolated-process)

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB/), version 3.x.

# [Extension 4.x+ (preview)](#tab/extensionv4/isolated-process)

This preview version of the Cosmos DB bindings extension introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md). 

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB/), version 4.x.

# [Functions 2.x+](#tab/functionsv2/csharp-script)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x. 

# [Extension 4.x+ (preview)](#tab/extensionv4/csharp-script)

This extension version is available from the preview extension bundle v4 by adding the following lines in your `host.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
    "version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```

## Install bundle    

The Cosmos DB is part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the binding, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

# [Bundle v2.x and v3.x](#tab/functionsv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x or 3.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-extension-bundles-json-v3](../../includes/functions-extension-bundles-json-v3.md)]

# [Bundle v4.x (Preview)](#tab/extensionv4)

This version of the bundle contains a preview version of the Cosmos DB bindings extension (version 4.x) that introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](./functions-reference.md#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](./functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial.md).

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript,programming-language-python,programming-language-java,programming-language-powershell"   

You can add this version of the extension from the preview extension bundle v4 by adding or replacing the following code in your `host.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
    "version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```
