# Azure Tables bindings for Azure Functions

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Tables](../cosmos-db/table/introduction.md) via [triggers and bindings](./functions-triggers-bindings.md). Integrating with Azure Tables allows you to build functions that read and write data using the Tables API for [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml) and [Cosmos DB](../cosmos-db/introduction.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Table bindings have historically only supported Azure Storage. Support for Cosmos DB is currently in preview. See [Table API extension (preview)](#table-api-extension).

| Action | Type |
|---------|---------|
| Read table data in a function | [Input binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-input.md) |
| Allow a function to write table data |[Output binding](./functions-bindings-storage-table-output.md) |

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app: 

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Functions execute in the same process as the Functions host. To learn more, see [Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library.md).

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running functions on .NET 5.0 in Azure](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

Functions run as C# script, which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. To update existing binding extensions for C# script apps running in the portal without having to republish your function app, see [Update your extensions].

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

<a name="storage-extension"></a>
<a name="table-api-extension"></a>

# [Table API extension](#tab/table-api/in-process)

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-supports-identity-connections-note.md)]

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Data.Tables](/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables). It also introduces the ability to use Cosmos DB Table APIs.

This extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables NuGet package][table-api-package] into a project using version 5.x or higher of the extensions for [blobs](./functions-bindings-storage-blob.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5) and [queues](./functions-bindings-storage-queue.md?tabs=in-process%2Cextensionv5).

Using the .NET CLI:

```dotnetcli
# Install the Tables API extension
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables --version 1.0.0

# Update the combined Azure Storage extension (to a version which no longer includes Tables)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage --version 5.0.0
``` 

[!INCLUDE [functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note](../../includes/functions-bindings-storage-extension-v5-tables-note.md)]

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/in-process)

Working with the bindings requires that you reference the appropriate NuGet package. Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage NuGet package][storage-4.x], version 3.x or 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x of the extension NuGet package or additionally include the [Table API extension](#table-api-extension) when using version 5.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/in-process)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

[!INCLUDE [functions-storage-sdk-version](../../includes/functions-storage-sdk-version.md)]

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/isolated-process)

Tables are included in a combined package for Azure Storage. Install the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/4.0.4), version 4.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Tables have been moved out of this package starting in its 5.x version. You need to instead use version 4.x.

# [Table API extension (preview)](#tab/table-api/isolated-process)

The Table API extension does not currently support isolated process. You will instead need to use the [Storage extension](#storage-extension).

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/isolated-process)

Functions version 1.x doesn't support isolated process.

# [Combined Azure Storage extension](#tab/storage-extension/csharp-script)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x. 

> [!NOTE]
> Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't include the Table Storage bindings. You need to instead use version 2.x for now.

# [Table API extension (preview)](#tab/table-api/csharp-script)

Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't currently include the Table API bindings. For now, you need to instead use version 2.x of the extension bundle, which uses the [Storage extension](#storage-extension).

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functionsv1/csharp-script)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs) NuGet package, version 2.x.

## Install bundle

The Azure Tables bindings are part of an [extension bundle], which is specified in your host.json project file. You may need to modify this bundle to change the version of the bindings, or if bundles aren't already installed. To learn more, see [extension bundle].

# [Bundle v3.x](#tab/extensionv3)

Version 3.x of the extension bundle doesn't currently include the Azure Tables bindings. You need to instead use version 2.x of the extension bundle.

# [Bundle v2.x](#tab/extensionv2)

You can install this version of the extension in your function app by registering the [extension bundle], version 2.x.

# [Functions 1.x](#tab/functions1)

Functions 1.x apps automatically have a reference to the extension.
