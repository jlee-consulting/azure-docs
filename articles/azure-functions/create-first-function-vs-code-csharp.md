# Quickstart: Create a C# function in Azure using Visual Studio Code

In this article, you use Visual Studio Code to create a C# function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions. This article creates an HTTP triggered function that runs on .NET 6.0. There's also a [CLI-based version](create-first-function-cli-csharp.md) of this article.

By default, this article shows you how to create C# functions that runs on .NET 6 [in the same process as the Functions host](functions-dotnet-class-library.md). These _in-process_ C# functions are only supported on Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET, such as .NET 6. To create C# functions on .NET 6 that can also run on .NET 5.0 and .NET Framework 4.8 (in preview) [in an isolated process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md), see the [alternate version of this article](create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md?tabs=isolated-process). 

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

## Configure your environment

Before you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

+ [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) version 4.x.

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).

+ [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for Visual Studio Code.  

+ [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code.

You also need an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).

## <a name="create-an-azure-functions-project"></a>Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in C#. Later in this article, you'll publish your function code to Azure.

1. Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar, then in the **Workspace (local)** area, select the **+** button, choose **Create Function** in the dropdown. When prompted, choose **Create new project**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/functions-create-first-function-vs-code/create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create a new project window.":::

1. Select the directory location for your project workspace and choose **Select**. You should either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace. Don't choose a project folder that is already part of a workspace.

1. Provide the following information at the prompts:

    # [.NET 6](#tab/in-process) 

    |Prompt|Selection|
    |--|--|
    |**Select a language**|Choose `C#`.|
    |**Select a .NET runtime** | Select `.NET 6`.|
    |**Select a template for your project's first function**|Choose `HTTP trigger`.|
    |**Provide a function name**|Type `HttpExample`.|
    |**Provide a namespace** | Type `My.Functions`. |
    |**Authorization level**|Choose `Anonymous`, which enables anyone to call your function endpoint. To learn about authorization level, see [Authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys).|
    |**Select how you would like to open your project**|Select `Add to workspace`.|

    # [.NET 6 Isolated](#tab/isolated-process)

    |Prompt|Selection|
    |--|--|
    |**Select a language**|Choose `C#`.|
    | **Select a .NET runtime** | Choose `.NET 6 Isolated`.|
    |**Select a template for your project's first function**|Choose `HTTP trigger`.|
    |**Provide a function name**|Type `HttpExample`.|
    |**Provide a namespace** | Type `My.Functions`. |
    |**Authorization level**|Choose `Anonymous`, which enables anyone to call your function endpoint. To learn about authorization level, see [Authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys).|
    |**Select how you would like to open your project**|Choose `Add to workspace`.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see .NET 6 as a runtime option, check the following:
    > 
    > + Make sure you have installed the .NET 6.0 SDK.
    > + Press F1 and type `Preferences: Open user settings`, then search for `Azure Functions: Project Runtime` and change the default runtime version to `~4`.  
    
1. Visual Studio Code uses the provided information and generates an Azure Functions project with an HTTP trigger. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. For more information about the files that are created, see [Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code.md?tabs=csharp#generated-project-files).

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code-csharp](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code-csharp.md)]

After checking that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

[!INCLUDE [functions-sign-in-vs-code](../../includes/functions-sign-in-vs-code.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-publish-project-vscode](../../includes/functions-publish-project-vscode.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-vs-code-run-remote](../../includes/functions-vs-code-run-remote.md)]

[!INCLUDE [functions-cleanup-resources-vs-code.md](../../includes/functions-cleanup-resources-vs-code.md)]

## Next steps

You have used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code.md?tabs=csharp) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next article, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Queue Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function.md?tabs=csharp).
