## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview resource](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You need Data Source Administrator and Data Reader permissions to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. For more information about permissions, see [Access control in Microsoft Purview](catalog-permissions.md).

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md). The minimal supported Self-hosted Integration Runtime version is 5.15.8079.1.

    * Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) is installed on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Restart the machine after you newly install the JDK for it to take effect.

    * Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679).

    * The connector reads metadata from SAP using the [SAP Java Connector (JCo)](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/jco.html) 3.0 API. Make sure the Java Connector is available on your machine where self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Make sure that you use the correct JCo distribution for your environment, and the **sapjco3.jar** and **sapjco3.dll** files are available.

        > [!Note]
        > The driver should be accessible to all accounts in the machine. Don't put it in a path under user account.

* Deploy the metadata extraction ABAP function module on the SAP server by following the steps mentioned in [ABAP functions deployment guide](abap-functions-deployment-guide.md). You need an ABAP developer account to create the RFC function module on the SAP server. The user account requires sufficient permissions to connect to the SAP server and execute the following RFC function modules:

    * STFC_CONNECTION (check connectivity)
    * RFC_SYSTEM_INFO (check system information)
    * OCS_GET_INSTALLED_COMPS (check software versions)
    * Z_MITI_BW_DOWNLOAD (main metadata import)

1. Navigate to **Sources**

1. Select the registered SAP BW source.

1. Select **+ New scan**

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan
