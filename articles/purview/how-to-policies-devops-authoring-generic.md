# Create, list, update and delete Microsoft Purview DevOps policies (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

[DevOps policies](concept-policies-devops.md) are a type of Microsoft Purview access policies. They allow you to manage access to system metadata on data sources that have been registered for *Data use management* in Microsoft Purview. These policies are configured directly in the Microsoft Purview governance portal, and after publishing, they get enforced by the data source.

This how-to guide covers how to provision access from Microsoft Purview to SQL-type data sources via *SQL Performance Monitoring* or *SQL Security Auditing* actions. Microsoft Purview access policies apply to Azure AD Accounts only.

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-generic.md)]

### Data source configuration
Before authoring policies in the Microsoft Purview policy portal, you'll need to configure the data sources so that they can enforce those policies.

1. Follow any policy-specific prerequisites for your source. Check the [Microsoft Purview supported data sources table](./microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) and select the link in the **Access Policy** column for sources where access policies are available. Follow any steps listed in the Access policy or Prerequisites sections.
1. Register the data source in Microsoft Purview. Follow the **Prerequisites** and **Register** sections of the [source pages](./microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) for your resources.
1. [Enable the "Data use management" toggle on the data source](how-to-enable-data-use-management.md). Additional permissions for this step are described in the linked document.


## Create a new DevOps policy
To create a new DevOps policy, ensure first that you have the Microsoft Purview Policy author role at **root collection level**. Check the section on managing Microsoft Purview role assignments in this [guide](./how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-roles-and-restrict-access-through-collections).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).

1. Navigate to the **Data policy** feature using the left side panel. Then select **DevOps policies**.

1. Select the **New Policy** button in the policy page. After that, the policy detail page will open.

1.  Select the **Data source type** and then one of the listed data sources under **Data source name**. Then click on **Select**. This will take you back to the New Policy experience

1. Select one of two roles, *SQL Performance monitor* or *SQL Security auditor*. Then select **Add/remove subjects**. This will open the Subject window. Type the name of an Azure AD principal (user, group or service principal) in the **Select subjects** box. Note that Microsoft 365 groups are not supported. Keep adding or removing subjects until you are satisfied. Select **Save**. This will take you back to the prior window.
