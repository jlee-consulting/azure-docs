# How to request access for a data asset

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

If you discover a data asset in the catalog that you would like to access, you can request access directly through Microsoft Purview. The request will trigger a workflow that will request that the owners of the data resource grant you access to that data source.

This article outlines how to make an access request.

> [!NOTE]
> For this option to be available for a resource, a [self-service access workflow](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md) needs to be created and assigned to the collection where the resource is registered. Contact the collection administrator, data source administrator, or workflow administrator of your collection for more information.
> Or, for information on how to create a self-service access workflow, see our [self-service access workflow documentation](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md).

## Request access

1. To find a data asset, use Microsoft Purview's [search](how-to-search-catalog.md) or [browse](how-to-browse-catalog.md) functionality.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this option isn't available, a [self-service access workflow](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md) either hasn't been created, or hasn't been assigned to the collection where the resource is registered. Contact the collection administrator, data source administrator, or workflow administrator of your collection for more information.
    > Or, for information on how to create a self-service access workflow, see our [self-service access workflow documentation](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md).

1. The **Request access** window will open. You can provide comments on why data access is requested.
1. Select **Send** to trigger the self-service data access workflow.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A request access to resource set will actually submit the data access request for the folder one level up which contains all these resource set files.

1. Data owners will be notified of your request and will either approve or reject the request.
