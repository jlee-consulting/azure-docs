> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View data estate insights from your Microsoft Purview account.
> * Get a bird's eye view of your data.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

For more information to create and complete a scan, see [the manage data sources in Microsoft Purview article](manage-data-sources.md).

## Understand your asset inventory in Data Estate Insights 

In Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights, you can get an overview of the assets that have been scanned into the Data Map and view key gaps that can be closed by governance stakeholders, for better governance of the data estate.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give asset insights 3-8 hours to reflect the new assets. The delay may be due to high traffic in deployment region or size of your workload. For further information, please contact support.

1. Navigate to your Microsoft Purview account in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Open Microsoft Purview governance portal** tile.

### View asset summary

1. The **Assets Summary** report provides several high-level KPIs, with these graphs:

   * **Unclassified assets**: Assets with no system or custom classification on the entity or its columns.
   * **Unassigned data owner**: Assets that have the owner attribute within "Contacts" tab as blank.
   * **Net new assets in last 30 days**: Assets that were added to the Purview account, via data scan or Atlas API pushes.
   * **Deleted assets in last 30 days**: Assets that were deleted from the Purview account, as a result of deletion from data sources.

1. Below these KPIs, you can also view your data asset distribution by collection.

1. Using filters you can drill down to assets within a specific collection or classification category.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the insights assets by collection section, with the filter at the top selected, showing available collections.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > ***Each classification filter has some common values:***
   > * **Applied**: Any filter value is applied
   > * **Not Applied**: No filter value is applied. For example, if you pick a classification filter with value as "Not Applied", the graph will show all assets with no classification.
   > * **All**: Filter values are cleared. Meaning the graph will show all assets, with or without classification.
   > * **Specific**: You have picked a specific classification from the filter, and only that classification will be shown.

1. To learn more about which specific assets are shown in the graph, select **View details**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/view-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the insights assets by collection section, with the view-details button at the bottom highlighted.":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/details-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the asset details view screen, which is still within the Data Estate Insights application.":::

1. You can select any collection to view the collection's asset list.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/select-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the asset details view screen, with one of the collections highlighted.":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-insights/asset-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the asset list screen, showing all assets within the selected collection.":::
 
1. You can also select an asset to edit without leaving the Data Estate Insights App.

### File-based source types

The next graphs in asset insights show a distribution of file-based source types. The first graph, called **Size trend (GB) of file type within source types**, shows top file type size trends over the last 30 days. 
 
1. Pick your source type to view the file type within the source. 
 
1. Select **View details** to see the current data size, change in size, current asset count and change in asset count.
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > If the scan has run only once in last 30 days or any catalog change like classification addition/removed happened only once in 30 days, then the change information above appears blank.

1. See the top folders with change top asset counts when you select source type.

1. Select the path to see the asset list.

The second graph in file-based source types is **Files not associated with a resource set**. If you expect that all files should roll up into a resource set, this graph can help you understand which assets haven't been rolled up. Missing assets can be an indication of the wrong file-pattern in the folder. You can select **View details** below the graph for more information.
