# Self-service access workflows for hybrid data estates

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

[Workflows](concept-workflow.md) allow you to automate some business processes through Microsoft Purview. Self-service access workflows allow you to create a process for your users to request access to datasets they've discovered in Microsoft Purview!

For example: let's say your team has a new data analyst who will be doing some business reporting. You add them to your department's collection in Microsoft Purview. From there they can browse the data assets and read descriptions about the data your department has available. They notice that one of the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 accounts seems to have the exact data they need to get started. Since a self-service access workflow has been set up for that resource, they can [request access](how-to-request-access.md) to that Azure Data Lake Storage account from within Microsoft Purview!

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/request-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a data asset's overview page, with the Request button highlighted in the mid-page menu.":::

You can create these workflows for any of your resources across your data estate to automate the access request process. Workflows are assigned at the [collection](reference-azure-purview-glossary.md#collection) level, and so automate business processes along the same organizational lines as your permissions.

This guide will show you how to create and manage self-service access workflows in Microsoft Purview.

>[!NOTE]
> To be able to create or edit a workflow, you'll need the to be in the [workflow admin role](catalog-permissions.md) in Microsoft Purview.
> You can also contact the workflow admin in your collection, or reach out to your collection administrator for permissions.

## Create and enable self-service access workflow

1. Sign in to [the Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/) and select the Management center. You'll see three new icons in the table of contents.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/workflow-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the management center left menu with the new workflow section highlighted.":::

1. To create new workflows, select Authoring. This will take you to the workflow authoring experience.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/workflow-authoring-experience.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the authoring workflows page, showing a list of all workflows.":::

    >[!NOTE]
    >If the authoring tab is greyed out, you don't have the permissions to be able to author workflows. You'll need the [workflow admin role](catalog-permissions.md).

1. To create a new self-service workflow, select the **+New** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/workflow-authoring-select-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the authoring workflows page, with the + New button highlighted.":::

1. You'll be presented with different categories workflows creatable in Microsoft Purview. To create **an access request workflow** Select **Governance** and select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/select-governance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new workflow window, with the Governance option selected.":::

1. In the next screen, you'll see all the templates provided by Microsoft Purview to create a self-service data access workflow. Select the template **Data access request** and select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/select-data-access-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new workflow window, with the Data access request option selected.":::

1. Next, enter workflow a name and optionally add a description. Then select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/name-and-continue.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new workflow window, with a name entered in the textbox.":::

1. You'll now be presented with a canvas where the selected template is loaded by default.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/workflow-canvas-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow canvas with the selected template workflow steps displayed." lightbox="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/workflow-canvas-expanded.png":::

    The template has the following steps: 
    1. Trigger when a data access request is made. 
    1. Approval connector that specifies a user or group that will be contacted to approve the request.
    1. Condition to check approval status 
        - If approved:
            1. Condition to check if data source is registered for [data use management](how-to-enable-data-use-governance.md) (policy) 
                1. If a data source is registered with policy:
                    1. Create a [self-service policy](concept-self-service-data-access-policy.md) 
                    1. Send email to requestor that access is provided 
                1. If data source isn't registered with policy:
                    1. Task connector to assign [a task](how-to-workflow-manage-requests-approvals.md#tasks) to a user or Microsoft Azure Active Directory group to manually provide access to requestor. 
                    1. Send an email to requestor that access is provided once the task is marked as complete. 
        - If rejected:
            1. Send an email to requestor that data access request is denied.
1. The default template can be used as it is by populating two fields:  
    * Adding an approver's email address or Microsoft Azure Active Directory group in **Start and Wait for approval** Connector 
    * Adding a user's email address or Microsoft Azure Active Directory group in **Create task** connector to denote who is responsible for manually providing access if the source isn't registered with policy.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Please configure the workflow to create self-service policies ONLY for sources supported by Microsoft Purview's policy feature. To see what's supported by policy, check the [Data owner policies documentation](tutorial-data-owner-policies-storage.md).
    >
    > If your source isn't supported by Microsoft Purview's policy feature, use the Task connector to assign [tasks](how-to-workflow-manage-requests-approvals.md#tasks) to users or groups that can provide access.

1. You can also modify the template by adding more connectors to suit your organizational needs. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/more-connectors-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow authoring canvas, with a + button highlighted on the arrow between the two top steps, and the Next Step button highlighted at the bottom of the workspace." lightbox="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/more-connectors-expanded.png":::

1. Once you're done defining a workflow, you need to bind the workflow to a collection hierarchy path. The binding (or scoping) implies that this workflow is triggered only for data access requests in that collection. To bind a workflow or to apply a scope to a workflow, you need to select **Apply workflow**. Select the scope you want this workflow to be associated with and select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/apply-workflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow workspace with the Apply workflow button selected at the top of the space, and the Apply workflow menu open, showing a list of items. One item is selected, and the O K button is highlighted at the bottom.":::

    >[!NOTE]
    > Purview workflow engine will always resolve to the closest workflow that the collection hierarchy path is associated with. In case a direct binding is not found, it will traverse up in the tree to find the workflow associated with the closest parent in the collection tree.

1. By default, the workflow will be enabled. You can disable by selecting the Enable toggle.
1. Finally select **Save and close** to create and enable the workflow.

## Edit an existing workflow

To modify an existing workflow, select the workflow and then select the **Edit** button. You'll now be presented with the canvas containing workflow definition. Modify the workflow and select **Save** to commit changes.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/select-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow authoring page, with the Edit button highlighted in the top menu.":::

## Disable a workflow

To disable a workflow, you can select the workflow and then select **Disable**. You can also disable the workflow by selecting **Edit** and changing the enable toggle in workflow canvas then saving.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/select-disable.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow authoring page, with the Disable button highlighted in the top menu.":::

## Delete a workflow

To delete a workflow, select the workflow and then select **Delete**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid/select-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the workflow authoring page, with the Delete button highlighted in the top menu.":::
