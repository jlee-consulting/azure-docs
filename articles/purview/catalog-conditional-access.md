# Conditional Access with Microsoft Purview

[Microsoft Purview](./overview.md) supports Microsoft Conditional Access.

The following steps show how to configure Microsoft Purview to enforce a Conditional Access policy.  

## Prerequisites

- When multi-factor authentication is enabled, to sign in to the Microsoft Purview governance portal, you must perform multi-factor authentication.

## Configure conditional access

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Conditional Access**. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Conditional Access technical reference](../active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions.md).
