# Resource group and subscription access provisioning by data owner (Preview)
[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

[Data owner policies](concept-policies-data-owner.md) are a type of Microsoft Purview access policies. They allow you to manage access to user data in sources that have been registered for *Data Use Management* in Microsoft Purview. These policies can be authored directly in the Microsoft Purview governance portal, and after publishing, they get enforced by the data source.

In this guide we cover how to register an entire resource group or subscription and then create a single policy that will manage access to **all** data sources in that resource group or subscription. That single policy will cover all existing data sources and any data sources that are created afterwards.

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic pre-requisites](./includes/access-policies-prerequisites-generic.md)]

**Only these data sources are enabled for access policies on resource group or subscription**. Follow the **Prerequisites** section that is specific to the data source(s) in these guides:
* [Data owner policies on an Azure Storage account](./how-to-policies-data-owner-storage.md#prerequisites)
* [Data owner policies on an Azure SQL Database](./how-to-policies-data-owner-azure-sql-db.md#prerequisites)*
* [Data owner policies on an Arc-enabled SQL Server](./how-to-policies-data-owner-arc-sql-server.md#prerequisites)*

(*) Only the *SQL Performance monitoring* and *Security auditing* actions are fully supported for SQL-type data sources. The *Read* action needs a workaround described later in this guide. The *Modify* action is not currently supported for SQL-type data sources.

## Microsoft Purview configuration

### Register the subscription or resource group for Data Use Management
The subscription or resource group needs to be registered with Microsoft Purview to later define access policies.

To register your subscription or resource group, follow the **Prerequisites** and **Register** sections of this guide:

- [Register multiple sources in Microsoft Purview](register-scan-azure-multiple-sources.md#prerequisites)

After you've registered your resources, you'll need to enable Data Use Management. Data Use Management needs certain permissions and can affect the security of your data, as it delegates to certain Microsoft Purview roles to manage access to the data sources. **Go through the secure practices related to Data Use Management in this guide**: [How to enable Data Use Management](./how-to-enable-data-use-management.md) 

In the end, your resource will have the  **Data Use Management** toggle **Enabled**, as shown in the screenshot:

>[!Important]
> - If you want to create a policy on a resource group or subscription and have it enforced in Arc-enabled SQL servers, you will need to also register those servers independently for *Data use management* to provide their App ID.

## Create and publish a data owner policy
Execute the steps in the **Create a new policy** and **Publish a policy** sections of the [data-owner policy authoring tutorial](./how-to-policies-data-owner-authoring-generic.md#create-a-new-policy). The result will be a data owner policy similar to the example shown in the image: a policy that provides security group *sg-Finance* *modify* access to resource group *finance-rg*. Use the Data source box in the Policy user experience.

>[!Important]
> - Publish is a background operation. For example, Azure Storage accounts can take up to **2 hours** to reflect the changes.
> - Changing a policy does not require a new publish operation. The changes will be picked up with the next pull.

>[!Warning]
> **Known Issues**
> - No implicit connect permission is provided to SQL type data sources (e.g.: Azure SQL DB, SQL server on Azure Arc-enabled servers) when creating a policy with *Read* action on a resource group or subscription. To support this scenario, provide the connect permission to the Azure AD principals locally, i.e. directly in the SQL-type data sources.

## Additional information
- Creating a policy at subscription or resource group level will enable the Subjects to access Azure Storage system containers,  for example, *$logs*. If this is undesired, first scan the data source and then create finer-grained policies for each (that is, at container or sub-container level).

### Limits
The limit for Microsoft Purview policies that can be enforced by Storage accounts is 100 MB per subscription, which roughly equates to 5000 policies.
