# Connect to and manage a Power BI tenant in Microsoft Purview (cross-tenant)

This article outlines how to register a Power BI tenant in a cross-tenant scenario, and how to authenticate and interact with the tenant in Microsoft Purview. If you're unfamiliar with the service, see [What is Microsoft Purview?](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata extraction**|  **Full scan**  |**Incremental scan**|**Scoped scan**|**Classification**|**Access policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| Yes | No | No | No| [Yes](how-to-lineage-powerbi.md)| No|

### Supported scenarios for Power BI scans

|**Scenario**  |**Microsoft Purview public access** |**Power BI public access** | **Runtime option** | **Authentication option**  | **Deployment checklist** | 
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Public access with Azure integration runtime     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Azure runtime      |Delegated authentication    | [Deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Public access with self-hosted integration runtime     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication  | [Deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |

### Known limitations

- For the cross-tenant scenario, delegated authentication is the only supported option for scanning.
- You can create only one scan for a Power BI data source that is registered in your Microsoft Purview account.
- If the Power BI dataset schema isn't shown after the scan, it's due to one of the current limitations with the [Power BI metadata scanner](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-metadata-scanning).
- Empty workspaces are skipped.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
  
## Deployment checklist

Use either of the following deployment checklists during the setup, or for troubleshooting purposes, based on your scenario.

# [Public access with Azure integration runtime](#tab/Scenario1)

### Scan cross-tenant Power BI by using delegated authentication in a public network

1. Make sure the Power BI and Microsoft Purview accounts are in the cross-tenant mode.

1. Make sure the Power BI tenant ID is entered correctly during the registration. By default, the Power BI tenant ID that exists in the same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instance as Microsoft Purview will be populated.

1. Make sure your [Power BI metadata model is up to date by enabling metadata scanning](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-metadata-scanning-setup#enable-tenant-settings-for-metadata-scanning).

1. From the Azure portal, validate if the Microsoft Purview account network is set to **public access**.

1. From the Power BI tenant admin portal, make sure the Power BI tenant is configured to allow a public network.

1. Check your instance of Azure Key Vault to make sure:
   1. There are no typos in the password.
   2. Microsoft Purview managed identity has get and list access to secrets.

   1. The user is assigned to the Power BI administrator role.
   2. At least one [Power BI license](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization#subscription-license-types) is assigned to the user.
   3. If the user is recently created, sign in with the user at least once, to make sure that the password is reset successfully, and the user can successfully initiate the session.
   4. There are no multifactor authentication or conditional access policies enforced on the user.

1. In the Power BI Azure AD tenant, validate the following app registration settings:
   1. The app registration exists in your Azure AD tenant where the Power BI tenant is located.
   2. Under **API permissions**, the following APIs are set up with **read** for **delegated permissions** and **grant admin consent for the tenant**:
      1. Power BI Service Tenant.Read.All
      2. Microsoft Graph openid
      3. Microsoft Graph User.Read
   3. Under **Authentication**:
      1. **Supported account types** > **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** is selected.
      2. **Implicit grant and hybrid flows** > **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)** is selected.

## Scan cross-tenant Power BI

Delegated authentication is the only supported option for cross-tenant scanning. You can use either Azure runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime to run a scan.

> [!TIP]
> To troubleshoot any issues with scanning:
> 1. Confirm you have completed the [deployment checklist for your scenario](#deployment-checklist).
> 1. Review the [scan troubleshooting documentation](register-scan-power-bi-tenant-troubleshoot.md).

To create and run a new scan by using the Azure runtime, perform the following steps:

1. Create a user account in the Azure AD tenant where the Power BI tenant is located, and assign the user to the Azure AD role, **Power BI Administrator**. Take note of the username and sign in to change the password.

1. Assign the proper Power BI license to the user.  

1. Go to the instance of Azure Key Vault in the tenant where Microsoft Purview is created.

1. Select **Settings** > **Secrets**, and then select **+ Generate/Import**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the instance of Azure Key Vault.":::

1. Enter a name for the secret. For **Value**, type the newly created password for the Azure AD user. Select **Create** to complete.
