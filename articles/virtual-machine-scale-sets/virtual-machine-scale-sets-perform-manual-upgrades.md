# Performing manual upgrades on Virtual Machine Scale Sets (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Manual upgrade policy for Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Uniform Orchestration is in general availability (GA).
>
>**Manual upgrade policy for Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Flexible Orchestration is currently in preview.** Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Some aspects of these features may change prior to general availability (GA). 
 
If you have the upgrade policy set to manual, any changes made to the scale set model won't be applied automatically. You need to manually trigger upgrades on each individual virtual machine. The manual upgrade functionality updates the selected instances according to the virtual machine configuration set in the scale set profile.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Select the Virtual Machine Scale Set you want to perform instance upgrades on. In the menu under **Settings**, select **Instances** and select the instances you want to upgrade. Once selected, click the **Upgrade** option.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [az vmss update-instances](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-update-instances). The `--instance-ids` parameter refers to the ID of the instance if using Uniform Orchestration and the instance name if using Flexible Orchestration.  

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss update-instances --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myScaleSet --instance-ids {instanceIds}
```
### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [Update-AzVmssInstance](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmssinstance). The `-InstanceId` parameter refers to the ID of the instance if using Uniform Orchestration and the instance name if using Flexible Orchestration. 
    
```azurepowershell-interactive
Update-AzVmssInstance -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet" -InstanceId instanceId
```

### [REST API](#tab/rest)
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [update instances](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/updateinstances). The `instanceIds` parameter refers to the ID of the instance if using Uniform Orchestration and the instance name if using Flexible Orchestration. 

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/myScaleSet/manualupgrade?api-version={apiVersion}

{
  "instanceIds": [
    "myScaleSet1",
    "myScaleSet2"
  ]
}

```
