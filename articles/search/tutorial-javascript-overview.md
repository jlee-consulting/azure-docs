# 1 - Overview of adding search to a website

In this Azure AI Search tutorial, create a web app that searches through a catalog of books, and then deploy the website to an Azure Static Web Apps resource. 

This tutorial is for JavaScript developers who want to create a frontend client app that includes search interactions like faceted navigation, typeahead, and pagination. It also demonstrates the `@azure/search-documents` library in the Azure SDK for JavaScript for calls to Azure AI Search for indexing and query workflows on the backend.

## What does the sample do? 

[!INCLUDE [tutorial-overview](includes/tutorial-add-search-website-what-sample-does.md)]

## How is the sample organized?

The [sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4) includes the following components:

|App|Purpose|GitHub<br>Repository<br>Location|
|--|--|--|
|Client|React app (presentation layer) to display books, with search. It calls the Azure Function app. |[/search-website-functions-v4/client](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4/client)|
|Server|Azure Function app (business layer) - calls the Azure AI Search API using JavaScript SDK |[/search-website-functions-v4/api](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4/api)|
|Bulk insert|JavaScript file to create the index and add documents to it.|[/search-website-functions-v4/bulk-insert](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4/bulk-insert)|

## Set up your development environment

Install the following software in your local development environment. 

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - Select latest runtime and version from this [list of supported language versions](../azure-functions/functions-versions.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript&tabs=azure-cli%2clinux%2cin-process%2cv4#languages).
    - If you have a different version of Node.js installed on your local computer, consider using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (`nvm`) or a Docker container.  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the following extensions
    - [Azure Static Web App](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps) 
    - Use the integrated terminal for command line operations.

- Optional:
    - This tutorial doesn't run the Azure Function API locally. If you intend to run it locally, you need to install [azure-functions-core-tools](../azure-functions/functions-run-local.md?tabs=linux%2ccsharp%2cbash) globally with the following bash command: 
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4
    ```

## Fork and clone the search sample with git

Forking the sample repository is critical to be able to deploy the Static Web App. The static web app determines the build actions and deployment content based on your own GitHub fork location. Code execution in the Static Web App is remote, with the static web app reading from the code in your forked sample.

1. On GitHub, [fork the sample repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples/fork). 

    Complete the fork process in your web browser with your GitHub account. This tutorial uses your fork as part of the deployment to an Azure Static Web App.

1. At a bash terminal, download your forked sample application to your local computer. 

    Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-ALIAS` with your GitHub alias. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ALIAS/azure-search-javascript-samples
    ```

1. At the same bash terminal, go into your forked repository for this website search example:

    ```bash
    cd azure-search-javascript-samples
    ```

1. Use the Visual Studio Code command, `code .` to open your forked repository. The remaining tasks are accomplished from Visual Studio Code, unless specified.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

## Create a resource group for your Azure resources
