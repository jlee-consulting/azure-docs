|------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| [Index aliases](search-how-to-alias.md) | An index alias is a secondary name that can be used to refer to an index for querying, indexing, and other operations. You can create an alias that maps to a search index and substitute the alias name in places where you would otherwise reference an index name. This gives you added flexibility if you ever need to change which index your application is pointing to. Instead of updating the references to the index name in your application, you can just update the mapping for your alias. | Public preview REST APIs (no portal support at this time).|

## Service re-brand

Azure Search was renamed to **Azure Cognitive Search** in October 2019 to reflect the expanded (yet optional) use of cognitive skills and AI processing in service operations. API versions, NuGet packages, namespaces, and endpoints are unchanged. New and existing search solutions are unaffected by the service name change.

## Service updates

[Service update announcements](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search&status=all) for Azure Cognitive Search can be found on the Azure web site.
