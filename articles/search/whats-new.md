## Service re-brand announcement

Azure Search was renamed to **Azure Cognitive Search** in October 2019 to reflect the expanded (yet optional) use of cognitive skills and AI processing in service operations. API versions, NuGet packages, namespaces, and endpoints are unchanged. New and existing search solutions are unaffected by the service name change.

## Service updates

[Service update announcements](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search&status=all) for Azure Cognitive Search can be found on the Azure web site.
