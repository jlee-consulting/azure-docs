# Azure OpenAI vectorizer

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This feature is in public preview under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). The [2023-10-01-Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) and all newer preview REST APIs support this feature.

The **Azure OpenAI** vectorizer connects to a deployed embedding model on your [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) resource to generate embeddings at query time. Your data is processed in the [Geo](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/) where your model is deployed. 

> [!NOTE]
> This vectorizer is bound to Azure OpenAI and is charged at the existing [Azure OpenAI pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/#pricing).

## Vectorizer parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `resourceUri` | The URI of the model provider, in this case, an Azure OpenAI resource. This parameter only supports URLs with domain `openai.azure.com`, such as `https://<resourcename>.openai.azure.com`. If the Azure OpenAI endpoint has a URL with domain `cognitiveservices.azure.com`, like `https://<resourcename>.cognitiveservices.azure.com`, a [custom subdomain](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/use-your-data-securely#enabled-custom-subdomain) with `openai.azure.com` must be created first for the Azure OpenAI resource and use `https://<resourcename>.openai.azure.com` instead.  |
| `apiKey`   |  The secret key used to access the model. If you provide a key, leave `authIdentity` empty. If you set both the `apiKey` and `authIdentity`, the `apiKey` is used on the connection. |
| `deploymentId`   | The name of the deployed Azure OpenAI embedding model. The model should be an embedding model, such as text-embedding-ada-002. See the [List of Azure OpenAI models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) for supported models.|
| `authIdentity`   | A user-managed identity used by the search service for connecting to Azure OpenAI. You can use either a [system or user managed identity](search-howto-managed-identities-data-sources.md). To use a system manged identity, leave `apiKey` and `authIdentity` blank. The system-managed identity is used automatically. A managed identity must have [Cognitive Services OpenAI User](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control#azure-openai-roles) permissions to send text to Azure OpenAI. |
| `modelName` | (Required in API version 2024-05-01-Preview and later). The name of the Azure OpenAI embedding model that is deployed at the provided `resourceUri` and `deploymentId`. Currently supported values are `text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-3-small` |

## Supported vector query types

The Azure OpenAI vectorizer only supports `text` vector queries.

## Expected field dimensions

The expected field dimensions for a field configured with an Azure OpenAI vectorizer depend on the `modelName` that is configured.

| `modelName` | Minimum dimensions | Maximum dimensions |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
| text-embedding-ada-002 | 1536 | 1536 |
| text-embedding-3-large | 1 | 3072 |
| text-embedding-3-small | 1 | 1536 |

        },
    }
]
