# View a knowledge store with Storage Explorer

A [knowledge store](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md) is content created by an Azure Cognitive Search skillset and saved to Azure Storage. In this article, you'll learn how to view the contents of a knowledge store using Storage Explorer in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Start with an existing knowledge store created in the [Azure portal](knowledge-store-create-portal.md) or using the [REST APIs](knowledge-store-create-rest.md). Both the portal and REST walkthroughs create a knowledge store in Azure Table Storage.

## Start Storage Explorer

1. In the Azure portal, [open the Storage account](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2storageAccounts/) that you used to create the knowledge store.

1. In the storage account's left navigation pane, select **Storage Explorer**.

## Edit and query tables

1. Expand the **TABLES** list to show a list of Azure table projections that were created when you created the knowledge store. If you used the quickstart or REST article to create the knowledge store, the tables will contain content related to customer reviews of a European hotel.

1. Select a table from the list.

1. To change the data type, property name, or individual data values in your table, click **Edit**.

1. To run queries, select **Query** on the command bar and enter your conditions.

In Storage Explorer, you can only query one table at time using [supported query syntax](/rest/api/storageservices/Querying-Tables-and-Entities). To query across tables, consider using Power BI instead.

## Next steps

Connect this knowledge store to Power BI to build visualizations that include multiple tables.
