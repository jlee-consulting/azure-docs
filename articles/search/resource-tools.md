# Productivity tools - Azure AI Search

Productivity tools are built by engineers at Microsoft, but aren't part of the Azure AI Search service and aren't under Service Level Agreement (SLA). These tools are provided as source code that you can download, modify, and build to create an app that helps you develop or maintain a search solution.

| Tool name | Description | Source code |
|-----------|------------ |-------------|
| [Back up and Restore](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python/code/index-backup-restore) | Download the retrievable fields of an index to your local device and then upload the index and its content to a new search service. | [https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python/code/index-backup-restore](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python/code/index-backup-restore) |
| [Chat with your data solution accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator/blob/main/README.md) |  Code and docs to create interactive search solution in production environments.  | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator) |
| [Knowledge Mining Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-knowledge-mining/blob/main/README.md) | Code and docs to jump start a knowledge store using your data. | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-knowledge-mining](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-knowledge-mining) |
| [Performance testing solution](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing/blob/main/README.md) | This solution helps you load test Azure AI Search. It uses Apache JMeter as an open source load and performance testing tool and Terraform to dynamically provision and destroy the required infrastructure on Azure. | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-performance-testing) |
| [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azurecognitivesearch) | Although the extension is no longer available in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, the code is open source. You can clone and modify the tool for your own use. | [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azurecognitivesearch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azurecognitivesearch) |
