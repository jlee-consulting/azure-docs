summary: |
    If you can't find answers to your questions and still need help, contact Microsoft Support.  
sections:
  - name: Data and privacy
    questions:
      - question: Where does Azure Operator Insights store customer data?
        answer: |
          Azure Operator Insights doesn't move or store customer data out of the region it's deployed in.
          
          The only exceptions to this are:
          - Data processing for the Azure Operator Insights Copilot feature (currently in preview). This is because Azure OpenAI Service used by the Copilot feature is not available in all regions yet. Data processing may happen cross region but within the same geo.
          - Data storage for the West Central US or South Central US regions. If you deploy to these regions, the data is stored in the East US region.
      - question: Does Azure Operator Insights support CMK-based encryption?
        answer: |
          Azure Operator Insights supports use of customer-managed key (CMK) for all regions except West Central US or South Central US.
