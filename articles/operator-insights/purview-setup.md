# Use Microsoft Purview with an Azure Operator Insights Data Product

This article outlines how to set up Microsoft Purview to explore an Azure Operator Insights Data Product.

Data governance is about managing data as a strategic asset, ensuring that there are controls in place around data, its content, structure, use, and safety. Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) is responsible for implementing data governance and allows you to monitor, organize, govern, and manage your entire data estate.

When it comes to Azure Operator Insights, Microsoft Purview provides simple overviews and catalogs of all Data Product resources. To integrate Microsoft Purview into your Data Product solution, provide your Microsoft Purview account and chosen collection when creating an Azure Operator Insights Data Product in the Azure portal.

The Microsoft Purview account and collection is populated with catalog details of your Data Product during the resource creation or resource upgrade process.

## Prerequisites

- You are in the process of creating or upgrading an Azure Operator Insights Data Product.

- If you don't have an existing Microsoft Purview account, [create a Purview account](../purview/create-microsoft-purview-portal.md) in the Azure portal.

## Access and set up your Microsoft Purview account

You can access your Purview account through the Azure portal by going to `https://web.purview.azure.com` and selecting your Microsoft Entra ID and account name. Or by going to `https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/<yourpurviewaccountname>`.

To begin to catalog a Data Product in this account, [create a collection](../purview/how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md) to hold the Data Product.

Provide the user-assigned managed identity (UAMI) for your Azure Operator Insights Data Product with necessary roles in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. This UAMI was set up when the Data Product was created. For information on how to set up this UAMI, see [Set up a user-assigned managed identity](data-product-create.md#set-up-a-user-assigned-managed-identity). At the desired collection, assign this UAMI to the **Collection admin**, **Data source admin**, and **Data curator** roles. Alternately, you can apply the UAMI at the root collection/account level. All collections would inherit these role assignments by default.

:::image type="content" source="media/purview-setup/data-product-role-assignments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of collections with Role assignment tab open and icon to add the UAMI to the collection admins role highlighted.":::

Assign roles to your users using effective role-based access control (RBAC). There are multiple roles that can be assigned, and assignments can be done on an account root and collection level. For more information, see how to [add roles and restrict access through collections](../purview/how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-roles-and-restrict-access-through-collections).

[Using the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](../purview/use-microsoft-purview-governance-portal.md) explains how to use the user interface and navigate the service. Microsoft Purview includes options to scan in data sources, but this option isn't required for integrating Azure Operator Insights Data Products with Microsoft Purview. When you complete this procedure, all Azure services and assets are automatically populated to your Purview catalog.

## Connect Microsoft Purview to your Data Product

When creating an Azure Operator Insights Data Product, select the **Advanced** tab and enable Purview.

:::image type="content" source="media/purview-setup/data-product-purview.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Advanced tab on Create a Data Product page in Azure Operator Insights.":::

Select **Select Purview Account** to provide the required values to populate a Purview collection with Data Product details.
- **Purview account name** - When you select your subscription, all Purview accounts in that subscription are available. Select the account you created.
- **Purview collection ID** - The five-character ID visible in the URL of the Purview collection. To find the ID, select your collection and the collection ID is the five characters following `?collection=` in the URL. In the following example, the Investment collection has the collection ID *50h55*.

## Understand Data Product representation in Microsoft Purview

A Data Product is made up of many Azure Services and Data Assets, which are represented as assets of multiple types inside the Microsoft Purview compliance portals. The following asset types are represented.

### Data Product

An overall representation of the Azure Operator Insights Data Product.

| **Additional fields** | **Description**                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Description           | Brief description of the Data Product         |
| Owners                | A list of owners of this Data Product         |
| Azure Region          | The region where the Data Product is deployed |
| Docs                  | A link to documents that explain the data     |

### AOI Data Lake

Also known as Azure Data Lake Storage.

| **Additional fields** | **Description**                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| DFS Endpoint Address  | Provides access to Parquet files in Azure Operator Insights Data Lake  |

### AOI Database

Also known as Azure Data Explorer.

| **Additional fields** | **Description**                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| KQL Endpoint Address  | Provides access to Azure Operator Insights tables for exploration using KQL  |

### AOI Table

Azure Data Explorer tables and materialized views.

| **Additional fields** | **Description**                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Description           | Brief description of each table and view     |
| Schema                | Contains the table columns and their details |

### AOI Parquet Details

Each Azure Data Explorer table is an equivalent Parquet file type.

| **Additional fields** | **Description**                                                   |
