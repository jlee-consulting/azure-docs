# What is Dynatrace integration with Azure?

Dynatrace is a monitoring solution that provides deep cloud observability, advanced AIOps, and continuous runtime application security capabilities in Azure.

Dynatrace for Azure (preview) offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage Dynatrace environments using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. This enables you to use Dynatrace as a monitoring solution for your Azure workloads through a streamlined workflow, starting from procurement, all the way to configuration and management.

You can create and manage the Dynatrace resources using the Azure portal through a resource provider named `Dynatrace.Observability`. Dynatrace owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the Dynatrace environments created through this experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Dynatrace for Azure only stores and processes customer data in the region where the service was deployed. No data is stored outside of that region.
