# Extend Azure with Azure Native ISV Services

Partner organizations use Azure Native ISV Services to offer solutions that you can use in Azure to enhance your cloud infrastructure. These Azure Native ISV Services are fully integrated into Azure. You work with these solutions in much the same way you would work with solutions from Microsoft. You use a resource provider, resource types, and SDKs to manage the solution.

Azure Native ISV Services are available through the Marketplace.
