# Connect Microsoft Defender for IoT sensors without direct internet access by using a proxy (legacy)

This article describes how to connect Microsoft Defender for IoT sensors to Defender for IoT via a proxy, with no direct internet access. This article is only relevant if you are using a legacy connection method via your own IoT Hub.

Starting with sensor software versions 22.1.x, updated connection methods are supported that don't require customers to have their own IoT Hub. For more information, see [Sensor connection methods](architecture-connections.md) and [Connect your sensors to Microsoft Defender for IoT](connect-sensors.md).

We recommend that you use the procedures in this article only if you are using a legacy sensor version lower than 22.1.x.

## Overview

Connect the sensor with a forwarding proxy that has HTTP tunneling, and uses the HTTP CONNECT command for connectivity. The instructions here are given uses the open-source Squid proxy, any other proxy that supports CONNECT can be used.

The proxy uses an encrypted SSL tunnel to transfer data from the sensors to the service. The proxy doesn't inspect, analyze, or cache any data.

The following diagram shows data going from Microsoft Defender for IoT to the IoT sensor in the OT segment to cloud via a proxy located in the IT network, and industrial DMZ.

## Set up your system

For this scenario we'll be installing, and configuring the latest version of [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) on an Ubuntu 18 server.

> [!Note]
> Microsoft Defender for IoT does not offer support for Squid or any other proxy service.

**To install Squid proxy on an Ubuntu 18 server**:

1. Sign in to your designated proxy Ubuntu machine.

1. Launch a terminal window.
 
1. Update your software to the latest version using the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update 
    ```

1. Install the Squid package using the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install squid 
    ```

1. Locate the squid configuration file that is located at `/etc/squid/squid.conf`, and `/etc/squid/conf.d/`.

1. Make a backup of the original file using the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo cp -v /etc/squid/squid.conf{,.factory}'/etc/squid/squid.conf' -> '/etc/squid/squid.conf.factory sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
    ```

1. Open `/etc/squid/squid.conf` in a text editor.

1. Search for `# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS`.

1. Add `acl sensor1 src <sensor-ip>`, and `http_access allow sensor1` into the file.

1. (Optional) Add more sensors by adding an extra line for each sensor.

1. Enable the Squid service to start at launch with the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable squid 
    ```

## Set up a sensor to use Squid

This section describes how to set up a sensor to use Squid.

**To set up a sensor to use Squid**:

1. Sign in to the sensor.

1. Navigate to **System settings** > **Basic**> **Sensor Network Settings**.

1. Turn on the **Enable Proxy** toggle.

1. Enter the proxy address.

1. Enter a port. The default port is `3128`.

1. (Optional) Enter a proxy user, and password.

1. Select **Save**.
