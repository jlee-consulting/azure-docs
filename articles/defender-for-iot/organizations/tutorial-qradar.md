# Integrate Qradar with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This article describes how to integrate Microsoft Defender for IoT with QRadar.

Integrating with QRadar supports:

- Forwarding Defender for IoT alerts to IBM QRadar for unified IT and OT security monitoring and governance.

- An overview of both IT and OT environments, allowing you to detect, and respond to multi-stage attacks that often cross IT, and OT boundaries.

- Integrating with existing SOC workflows.

## Configure Syslog listener for QRadar

**To configure the Syslog listener to work with QRadar**:

1. Sign in to QRadar and select **Admin** > **Data Sources**.

1. In the Data Sources window, select **Log Sources**. For example:

   [:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-qradar/log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a log sources from the available options.":::](media/tutorial-qradar/log.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Modal** window, select **Add**. For example:

    [:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-qradar/modal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of after selecting Syslog the modal window opens.":::](media/tutorial-qradar/modal.png#lightbox)

1. In the **Add a log source** dialog box, define the following parameters:

   - **Log Source Name**: `<Sensor name>`

   - **Log Source Description**: `<Sensor name>`

   - **Log Source Type**: `Universal LEEF`

   - **Protocol Configuration**: `Syslog`

   - **Log Source Identifier**: `<Sensor name>`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Log Source Identifier name must not include white spaces. We recommend replacing any white spaces with an underscore.

1. Select **Save** > **Deploy Changes**. For example.

## Deploy a Defender for IoT QID

A **QID** is a QRadar event identifier. Since all Defender for IoT reports are tagged under the same, **Sensor Alert** event, you can use the same QID for these events in QRadar.

**To deploy a Defender for IoT QID**:

1. Sign in to the QRadar console.

1. Create a file named `xsense_qids`.

1. In the file, use the following command: `,XSense Alert,XSense Alert Report From <XSense Name>,5,7001`.

1. Run: `sudo /opt/qradar/bin/qidmap_cli.sh -i -f <path>/xsense_qids`. 

   A confirmation message appears, indicating that the QID was deployed successfully.

## Create QRadar forwarding rules

Create a forwarding rule from your on-premises management console to forward alerts to QRadar.

**To create a QRadar forwarding rule**:

1. Sign in to the on-premises management console and select **Forwarding** on the left.

1. Select the **+** to create a new rule.

1. Enter values for the rule name and conditions. In the **Actions** area, select **Add**, and then select **Qradar**. For example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-qradar/create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a Forwarding Rule window.":::

1. Define the QRadar IP address and timezone, and then select **Save**.

The following is an example of a payload sent to QRadar:

```sample payload
<9>May 5 12:29:23 sensor_Agent LEEF:1.0|CyberX|CyberX platform|2.5.0|CyberX platform Alert|devTime=May 05 2019 15:28:54 devTimeFormat=MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss sev=2 cat=XSense Alerts title=Device is Suspected to be Disconnected (Unresponsive) score=81 reporter=192.168.219.50 rta=0 alertId=6 engine=Operational senderName=sensor Agent UUID=5-1557059334000 site=Site zone=Zone actions=handle dst=192.168.2.2 dstName=192.168.2.2 msg=Device 192.168.2.2 is suspected to be disconnected (unresponsive).
```

## Map notifications to QRadar

1. Sign into your QRadar console, select **QRadar**> **Log Activity** .

1. Select **Add Filter** and define the following parameters:

   - **Parameter**: `Log Sources [Indexed]`
   - **Operator**: `Equals`
   - **Log Source Group**: `Other`
   - **Log Source**: `<Xsense Name>`

1. Locate an unknown report detected from your Defender for IoT sensor and double-click it.

1. Select **Map Event**.

1. In the **Modal Log Source Event** page, select:

   - **High-Level Category**: Suspicious Activity + Low-Level Category - Unknown Suspicious Event + Log
   - **Source Type**: Any

1. Select **Search**.

1. From the results, select the line in which the name XSense appears, and select **OK**.

All of the sensor reports from now on are tagged as Sensor Alerts.

The following new fields appear in QRadar:

- **UUID**: Unique alert identifier, such as 1-1555245116250.

- **Site**: The site where the alert was discovered.

- **Zone**: The zone where the alert was discovered.

For example:

```rest
<9>May 5 12:29:23 sensor_Agent LEEF:1.0|CyberX|CyberX platform|2.5.0|CyberX platform Alert|devTime=May 05 2019 15:28:54 devTimeFormat=MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss sev=2 cat=XSense Alerts title=Device is Suspected to be Disconnected (Unresponsive) score=81 reporter=192.168.219.50 rta=0 alertId=6 engine=Operational senderName=sensor Agent UUID=5-1557059334000 site=Site zone=Zone actions=handle dst=192.168.2.2 dstName=192.168.2.2 msg=Device 192.168.2.2 is suspected to be disconnected (unresponsive).
```

> [!NOTE]
> The forwarding rule you create for QRadar uses the `UUID` API from the on-premises management console. For more information, see [UUID (Manage alerts based on the UUID)](api/management-alert-apis.md#uuid-manage-alerts-based-on-the-uuid).

## Add custom fields to the alerts

**To add custom fields to alerts**:

1. Select **Extract Property**.

1. Select **Regex Based**.

1. Configure the following fields:

   - New Property: _choose from the list below_

      - Sensor Alert Description
      - Sensor Alert ID
      - Sensor Alert Score
      - Sensor Alert Title
      - Sensor Destination Name
      - Sensor Direct Redirect
      - Sensor Sender IP
      - Sensor Sender Name
      - Sensor Alert Engine
      - Sensor Source Device Name

   - Check **Optimize Parsing**

   - Field Type: `AlphaNumeric`

   - Check **Enabled**

   - Log Source Type: `Universal LEAF`

   - Log Source: `<Sensor Name>`

   - Event Name (should be already set as Sensor Alert)

   - Capture Group: 1

   - Regex:

      - Sensor Alert Description RegEx: `msg=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Alert ID RegEx: `alertId=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Alert Score RegEx: `Detected score=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Alert Title RegEx: `title=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Destination Name RegEx: `dstName=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Direct Redirect RegEx: `rta=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Sender IP: RegEx: `reporter=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Sender Name RegEx: `senderName=(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Alert Engine RegEx: `engine =(.*)(?=\t)`
      - Sensor Source Device Name RegEx: `src`
