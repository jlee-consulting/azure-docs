# Integrate LogRhythm with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This article describes how to send Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts to LogRhythm. Integrating Defender for IoT with LogRhythm provides visibility into the security and resiliency of OT networks and a unified approach to IT and OT security.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Defender for IoT OT sensor as an Admin user.

## Create a Defender for IoT forwarding rule

This procedure describes how to create a forwarding rule from your OT sensor to send Defender for IoT alerts from that sensor to LogRhythm.

For more information, see [Forward alert information](../how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md).

1. Sign in to your OT sensor console and select **Forwarding** on the left.

1. Enter a meaningful name for your rule, and then define your rule details, including:

    - The minimal alert level. For example, if you select Minor, you are notified about all minor, major and critical incidents.
    - The protocols you want to include in the rule.
    - The traffic you want to include in the rule.

1. In the **Actions** area, define the following values:

    - **Server**: Select a SYSLOG server option, such as **SYSLOG Server (LEEF format)
    - **Host**: The IP or hostname of your LogRhythm collector
    - **Port**: Enter **514**
    - **Timezone**: Enter your timezone

1. Select **Save** to save your forwarding rule.

## Configure LogRhythm to collect logs

After configuring a forwarding rule from your OT sensor console, configure LogRhythm to collect your Defender for IoT logs.

For more information, see the [LogRhythm documentation](https://docs.logrhythm.com/docs/devices/syslog-log-sources).
