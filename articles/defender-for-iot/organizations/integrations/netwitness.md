# Integrate RSA NetWitness with Microsoft Defender for IoT

This article describes how to send Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts to RSA NetWitness. Integrating Defender for IoT with NetWitness provides visibility into the security and resiliency of OT networks and a unified approach to IT and OT security.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Defender for IoT OT sensor as an Admin user.

- NetWitness configuration to collect events from sources that support Common Event Format (CEF). For more information, see the [CyberX Platform - RSA NetWitness CEF Parser Implementation Guide](https://community.netwitness.com//t5/netwitness-platform-integrations/cyberx-platform-rsa-netwitness-cef-parser-implementation-guide/ta-p/554364).

## Create a Defender for IoT forwarding rule

This procedure describes how to create a forwarding rule from your OT sensor to send Defender for IoT alerts from that sensor to NetWitness.

For more information, see [Forward alert information](../how-to-forward-alert-information-to-partners.md).

1. Sign in to your OT sensor console and select **Forwarding** on the left.

1. Enter a meaningful name for your rule, and then define your rule details, including:

    - The minimal alert level. For example, if you select Minor, you are notified about all minor, major and critical incidents.
    - The protocols you want to include in the rule.
    - The traffic you want to include in the rule.

1. In the **Actions** area, define the following values:

    - **Server**: Select **NetWitness**
    - **Host**: The NetWitness hostname
    - **Port**: The NetWitness port
    - **Timezone**: Enter your NetWitness timezone

1. Select **Save** to save your forwarding rule.
