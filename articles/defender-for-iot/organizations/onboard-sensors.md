# Onboard sensors to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal

This article describes how to onboard sensors with [Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started).

## Purchase sensors or download software for sensors

This procedure describes how to use the Azure portal to contact vendors for pre-configured appliances, or how to download software for you to install on your own appliances. 

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Defender for IoT** > **Getting started** > **Sensor**.

1. Do one of the following:

    - To buy a pre-configured appliance, select **Contact** under **Buy preconfigured appliance**. This opens an email to [hardware.sales@arrow.com](mailto:hardware.sales@arrow.com) with a template request for Defender for IoT appliances. For more information, see [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md).

    - To install software on your own appliances, do the following:

        1. Make sure that you have a supported appliance available.

        1. Under *Select version**, select the software version you want to install. We recommend that you always select the most recent version.

        1. Select **Download**. Download the sensor software and save it in a location that you can access from your selected appliance.

        1. Install your software. For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

## Onboard OT sensors

Onboard an OT sensor by registering it with Microsoft Defender for IoT and downloading a sensor activation file.

> [!NOTE]
> Enterprise IoT sensors also require onboarding and activation, with slightly different steps. For more information, see [Tutorial: Get started with Enterprise IoT](tutorial-getting-started-eiot-sensor.md).
>

**Prerequisites**: Make sure that you've set up your sensor and configured your SPAN port or TAP. For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

**To onboard your sensor to Defender for IoT**:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Defender for IoT** > **Getting started** and select **Set up OT/ICS Security**. Alternately, from the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page, select **Onboard OT sensor**.

1. By default, on the **Set up OT/ICS Security** page, **Step 1: Did you set up a sensor?** and **Step 2: Configure SPAN port or TAPâ€‹** of the wizard are collapsed. If you haven't completed these steps, do so before continuing.

1. In **Step 3: Register this sensor with Microsoft Defender for IoT** enter or select the following values for your sensor:

    1. In the **Sensor name** field, enter a meaningful name for your sensor.  We recommend including your sensor's IP address as part of the name, or using another easily identifiable name, that can help you keep track between the registration name in the Azure portal and the IP address of the sensor shown in the sensor console.

    1. In the **Subscription** field, select your Azure subscription.

    1. Toggle on the **Cloud connected** option to have your sensor connected to other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel, and to push [threat intelligence packages](how-to-work-with-threat-intelligence-packages.md) from Defender for IoT to your sensors.

    1. In the **Sensor version** field, select which software version is installed on your sensor machine. We recommend that you select **22.X and above** to get all of the latest features and enhancements.

        If you haven't yet upgraded to version 22.x, see [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

    1. In the **Site** section, select the **Resource name** and enter the **Display name** for your site. Add any tags as needed to help you identify your sensor.

    1. In the **Zone** field, select a zone from the menu, or select **Create Zone** to create a new one.

1. Select **Register**.

A success message appears and your activation file is automatically downloaded, and your sensor is now shown under the configured site on the Defender for IoT **Sites and sensors** page.

However, until you activate your sensor, the sensor's status will show as **Pending Activation**.

Make the downloaded activation file accessible to the sensor console admin so that they can activate the sensor. For more information, see [Upload new activation files](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-new-activation-files).
