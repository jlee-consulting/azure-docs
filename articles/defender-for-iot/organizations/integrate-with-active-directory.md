# Integrate with Active Directory servers

Configure the sensor or on-premises management console to work with Active Directory. This allows Active Directory users to access the Microsoft Defender for IoT consoles by using their Active Directory credentials.

> [!Note]
> LDAP v3 is supported.

Two types of LDAP-based authentication are supported:

- **Full authentication**: User details are retrieved from the LDAP server. Examples are the first name, last name, email, and user permissions.

- **Trusted user**: Only the user password is retrieved. Other user details that are retrieved are based on users defined in the sensor.

For more information, see [networking requirements](how-to-set-up-your-network.md#other-firewall-rules-for-external-services-optional).

## Active Directory and Defender for IoT permissions

You can associate Active Directory groups defined here with specific permission levels. For example, configure a specific Active Directory group and assign Read-only permissions to all users in the group.

## Active Directory configuration guidelines

- You must define the LDAP parameters here exactly as they appear in Active Directory.
- For all the Active Directory parameters, use lowercase only. Use lowercase even when the configurations in Active Directory use uppercase.
- You can't configure both LDAP and LDAPS for the same domain. You can, however, use both for different domains at the same time.

**To configure Active Directory**:

1. From the left pane, select **System Settings**.
1. Select **Integrations** and then select **Active Directory**.

1. Enable the **Active Directory Integration Enabled** toggle.

1. Set the Active Directory server parameters, as follows:

   | Server parameter | Description |
   |--|--|
   | Domain controller FQDN | Set the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) exactly as it appears on your LDAP server. For example, enter `host1.subdomain.domain.com`. |
   | Domain controller port | Define the port on which your LDAP is configured. |
   | Primary domain | Set the domain name (for example, `subdomain.domain.com`) and the connection type according to your LDAP configuration. |
   | Active Directory groups | Enter the group names that are defined in your Active Directory configuration on the LDAP server. You can enter a group name that you'll associate with Admin, Security Analyst and Read-only permission levels. Use these groups when creating new sensor users.|
   | Trusted domains | To add a trusted domain, add the domain name and the connection type of a trusted domain. <br />You can configure trusted domains only for users who were defined under users. |

    ### Active Directory groups for the on-premises management console

    If you're creating Active Directory groups for on-premises management console users, you must create an Access Group rule for each Active Directory group. On-premises management console Active Directory credentials won't work if an Access Group rule doesn't exist for the Active Directory user group. For more information, see [Define global access control](how-to-define-global-user-access-control.md).

1. Select **Save**.

1. To add a trusted server, select **Add Server** and configure another server.
