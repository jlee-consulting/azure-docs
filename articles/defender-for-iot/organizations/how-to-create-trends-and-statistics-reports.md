# Create trends and statistics dashboards

This article describes how to create dashboards on your sensor console to get insight into network trends and statistics.


## Before you start

You need Administrator or Security Analyst permissions to create dashboards.

## Create dashboards

You can create many different types of dashboard. Based on traffic, device state, alerts, connectivity, and protocol.

1. On your Defender for IoT sensor console, select **Trends & Statistics** > **Create Dashboard**.

1. In the **Create Dashboard** pane that appears  on the right:

    - In the **Dashboard name** field, enter a meaningful name for your dashboard.
    - (Optional) Filter the widgets displayed by selecting a category or protocol from the **Dashboard widget type** menu.
    - Scroll down as needed and select the widget you want to add. Each widget has a short description and indicates whether it focuses on operations, security, or traffic.
    - Select **Save** to start your new dashboard.

1. Your widget is added to the new dashboard. Use the toolbar at the top of page to continue modifying your dashboard.

By default, results are displayed for detections for over the last seven days. Select the **Filter** button at the top left of each widget to change this range.

> [!NOTE]
> The time shown in the widget is set according to the sensor machine's time.

## Sample widgets

The following table summarizes common use cases for dashboard widgets.

Widget name | Sample use case
--- | ---
Busy devices | Lists the five busiest devices. In **Edit** mode, you can filter by known protocols.
Total bandwidth | Tracks the bandwidth in Mbps (megabits per second). The bandwidth is indicated on the y-axis, with the date appearing on the x-axis. **Edit** mode allows you to filter results.
Channels bandwidth | Displays the top five traffic channels. You can filter by Address, and set the number of Presented Results. Select the down arrow to show more channels.
Traffic by port | Displays the traffic by port, which is indicated by a pie chart with each port designated by a different color. The amount of traffic in each port is proportional to the size of its part of the pie.
New devices | Displays the new devices bar chart, which indicates how many new devices were discovered on a particular date.
Protocol dissection | Displays a pie chart that provides you with a look at the traffic per protocol, dissected by function codes, and services. The size of each slice of the pie is proportional to the amount of traffic relative to the other slices.
Active TCP connections | Displays a chart that shows the number of active TCP connections in the system.
Incident by type | Displays a pie chart that shows the number of incidents by type. This is the number of alerts generated by each engine over a predefined time period.
Devices by vendor | Displays a pie chart that shows the number of devices by vendor. The number of devices for a specific vendor is proportional to the size of that deviceâ€™s vendor part of the disk relative to other device vendors.
Number of devices per VLAN | Displays a pie chart that shows the number of discovered devices per VLAN. The size of each slice of the pie is proportional to the number of discovered devices relative to the other slices. Each VLAN appears with the VLAN tag assigned by the sensor or name that you've manually added.
Top bandwidth by VLAN | Displays the bandwidth consumption by VLAN. By default, the widget shows five VLANs with the highest bandwidth usage. You can filter the data by the period presented in the widget. Select the down arrow to show more results.
