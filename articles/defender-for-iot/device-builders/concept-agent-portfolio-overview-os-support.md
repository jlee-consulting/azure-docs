# Agent portfolio overview and OS support (Preview)

Microsoft Defender for IoT provides a large portfolio of agents based on the device type.

## Standalone and Edge agent

Most of the Linux Operating Systems (OS) are covered by both agents. The agents can be deployed as a binary package, or as a source code that can be incorporated as part of the firmware. The customer can modify, and customize the agents as needed.  The following are some examples of supported OS:

| Operating system | AMD64 | ARM32v7 | ARM64 |
|--|--|--|
| Debian 9 | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Debian 10| ✓ | ✓ | |
| Debian 11| ✓ | ✓ | |
| Ubuntu 18.04 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

For a more granular view of the micro agent-operating system dependencies, see [Linux dependencies](concept-micro-agent-linux-dependencies.md#linux-dependencies).

For additional information on supported operating systems, or to request access to the source code so you can incorporate it as a part of the device's firmware, contact your account manager, or send an email to <defender_micro_agent@microsoft.com>.

## Azure RTOS micro agent

The Microsoft Defender for IoT micro agent provides a comprehensive and lightweight security solution for devices that use Azure RTOS. Microsoft Defender for IoT micro agent provides coverage for common threats, and potential malicious activities on real-time operating system (RTOS) devices. The micro agent comes built in as part of the Azure RTOS NetX Duo component, and monitors the device's network activity.
