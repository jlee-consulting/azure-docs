# Chicago Safety Data

Chicago 311 service request call data covers

- all open sanitation code complaints made to 311
- all requests completed since January 1, 2011
- historical sanitation code complaints
- pot hole reports
- street light issues

The Department of Streets and Sanitation investigates and remedies reported violations of Chicago’s sanitation code. Residents can request service for overflowing dumpster and alley garbage violations, for example. The Chicago 311 service sometimes receives duplicate sanitation code complaints. Identified duplicate service requests are located in the same geographic area as a previous request, and were entered into the 311 Customer Service Request (CSR) system at about the same time. Duplicate complaints are labeled as such in the status field, as either "Open - Dup" or "Completed - Dup."

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset usage notice](./includes/open-datasets-usage-note.md)]

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees pothole repair for 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives pothole reports through the 311 call center. CDOT uses a mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and schedule crews.

One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a pothole based on a 311 call, that crew fills all the other potholes found on that block. Pothole repairs are completed within seven days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, frigid temps, and precipitation can influence the time needed to complete a pothole repair. On days of cooperative weather and no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.

If a previous request is already open for a buffer of four addresses, the request gets a status of "Duplicate (Open)" status. For example, for an existing CSR for address **6535 N Western**, and 311 receives a new CSR for address **6531 N Western**, then the new request receives a status of “Duplicate (Open)”, the new request receives a "Duplicate (Open)" status. In this example, the new CSR is at an address within four addresses of the original CSR. Once the crews repair the street, the CSR status reads “Completed” for the original request, and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or were filled. If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then the issue is directed to the appropriate department or contractor.

Open reports made to 311 of street light outages involving three or more lights are defined as "Street Lights - All Out." The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. Whenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure they all operate properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).” Since the CDOT electrician looks at the lights in a circuit to verify their operation, any “Duplicate (Open)” address is automatically observed and repaired. Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR reads “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when

- the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning
- the service request is for a nonexistent address
- a contractor maintains the lights

The data resource received daily updates.
