## Principles

Microsoft Energy Data Services conforms to the following principles:

### Fully managed OSDU&trade; platform

Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview is a first-party PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering where Microsoft manages the deployment, monitoring, management, scale, security, updates, and upgrades of the service so that the customers can focus on the value from the platform. Microsoft offers seamless upgrades to the latest OSDU&trade; milestone versions after testing and validation.

Furthermore, Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview provides security capabilities like encryption for data-in-transit and data-at-rest. The authentication and authorization are provided by Azure Active Directory. Microsoft also assumes the responsibility of providing regular security patches and updates.

Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview also supports multiple data partitions for every platform instance. More data partitions can also be created after creating an instance, as needed.

As an Azure-based service, it also provides elasticity with auto-scaling to handle dynamically varying workload requirements. The service provides out-of-the-box compatibility and built-in integration with industry-leading applications from SLB, including Petrel to provide quick time to value.

Microsoft will provide support for the platform to enable our customers' use cases.

### Accelerated innovation with openness in mind

Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview is compatible with the OSDU&trade; Technical Standard enables seamless integration of existing applications that have been developed in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU&trade; Standard.

The platform's openness and integration with Microsoft Azure Marketplace brings industry-leading applications, solutions, and integration services offered by our extensive partner ecosystem to our customers.

### Extensibility with the Microsoft ecosystem

Most of our customers rely on ubiquitous tools and applications from Microsoft. The Microsoft Energy Data Services Preview platform is piloting how it can seamlessly work with deeply used Microsoft apps like SharePoint for data ingestion, Synapse for data transformations and pipelines, Power BI for data visualization, and other possibilities. A Power BI connector has already been released in the community, and partners are leveraging these tools and connectors to enhance their integrations with Microsoft apps and services.

OSDU&trade; is a trademark of The Open Group.
