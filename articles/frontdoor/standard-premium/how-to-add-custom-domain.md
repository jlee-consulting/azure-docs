# Configure a custom domain on Azure Front Door using the Azure portal

When you use Azure Front Door for application delivery, a custom domain is necessary if you would like your own domain name to be visible in your end-user requests. Having a visible domain name can be convenient for your customers and useful for branding purposes.

After you create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile, the default frontend host will have a subdomain of `azurefd.net`. This subdomain gets included in the URL when Azure Front Door Standard/Premium delivers content from your backend by default. For example, `https://contoso-frontend.azurefd.net/activeusers.htm`. For your convenience, Azure Front Door provides the option of associating a custom domain with the default host. With this option, you deliver your content with a custom domain in your URL instead of an Azure Front Door owned domain name. For example, `https://www.contoso.com/photo.png`.

## Prerequisites

* Before you can complete the steps in this tutorial, you must first create a Front Door. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Front Door Standard/Premium](create-front-door-portal.md).

* If you don't already have a custom domain, you must first purchase one with a domain provider. For example, see [Buy a custom domain name](../../app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain.md).

* If you're using Azure to host your [DNS domains](../../dns/dns-overview.md), you must delegate the domain provider's domain name system (DNS) to an Azure DNS. For more information, see [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](../../dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md). Otherwise, if you're using a domain provider to handle your DNS domain, you must manually validate the domain by entering prompted DNS TXT records.

## Add a new custom domain

> [!NOTE]
> * If a custom domain is validated in one of the Azure Front Door Standard, Premium, classic or classic Microsoft CDN profiles, then it can't be added to another profile.

A custom domain is managed by Domains section in the portal. A custom domain can be created and validated before association to an endpoint. A custom domain and its subdomains can be associated with only a single endpoint at a time. However, you can use different subdomains from the same custom domain for different Front Doors. You can also map custom domains with different subdomains to the same Front Door endpoint.

1. Select **Domains** under settings for your Azure Front Door profile and then select **+ Add** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-domain-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add domain button on domain landing page.":::

1. The **Add a domain** page will appear where you can enter information about of the custom domain. You can choose Azure-managed DNS, which is recommended or you can choose to use your own DNS provider. If you choose Azure-managed DNS, select an existing DNS zone and then select a custom subdomain or create a new one. If you're using another DNS provider, manually enter the custom domain name. Select **Add** to add your custom domain.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Azure Front Door supports both Azure managed certificate and customer-managed certificates. If you want to use customer-managed certificate, see [Configure HTTPS on a custom domain](how-to-configure-https-custom-domain.md).

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-domain-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a domain page.":::

    A new custom domain is created with a validation state of **Submitting**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validation-state-submitting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of domain validation state submitting.":::

    Wait until the validation state changes to **Pending**. This operation could take a few minutes.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validation-state-pending.png" alt-text="Screenshot of domain validation state pending.":::

1. Select the **Pending** validation state. A new page will appear with DNS TXT record information needed to validate the custom domain. The TXT record is in the form of `_dnsauth.<your_subdomain>`. If you're using Azure DNS-based zone, select the **Add** button and a new TXT record with the displayed record value will be created in the Azure DNS zone. If you're using another DNS provider, manually create a new TXT record of name `_dnsauth.<your_subdomain>` with the record value as shown on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validate-custom-domain.png" alt-text="Screenshot of validate custom domain page.":::

1. Close the page to return to custom domains list landing page. The provisioning state of custom domain should change to **Provisioned** and validation state should change to **Approved**.

### Domain validation state

| Domain validation state | Description and actions |
| -- | -- |
| Submitting | When a new custom domain is added and being created, the validation state becomes Submitting. |
| Pending | A domain goes to pending state once the DNS TXT record challenge is generated. Please add the DNS TXT record to your DNS provider and wait for the validation to complete. If it is in ‘Pending’ even after the TXT record is updated in the DNS provider, please try to click ‘Regenerate’ to refresh the TXT record and add the TXT record to your DNS provider again. |
| Rejected | This state is applicable when the certificate provider/authority rejects the issuance for the managed certificate, e.g. when the domain is invalid. Please click on the ‘Rejected’ link and click ‘Regenerate’ on the ‘Validate the custom domain’ page, as shown in the screenshots below this table. Then click on Add to add the TXT record in the DNS provider. |
| TimeOut | The domain validation state will become from ‘Pending’ to ‘Timeout’ if you do not add it to your DNS provider within 7 days or add an invalid DNS TXT record. Please click on the Timeout and hit ‘Regenerate’ on the ‘Validate the custom domain’ page, as shown in the screenshots below this table. Then click on Add. Repeat step 3 and 4. |
| Approved | This means the domain has been successfully validated. |
| Pending re-validation | This happens when the managed certificate is 45 days or less from expiry. If you have a CNAME record pointing to the AFD endpoint, no action is required for certificate renewal. If the custom domain is pointing to other CNAME records, please click on ‘Pending Revalidation’ and hit ‘Regenerate’ on the ‘Validate the custom domain’ page, as shown in the screenshots below this table. Then click on Add or add the TXT record with your own DNS provider’s DNS management. |
| Refreshing validation token | A domain goes to “Refreshing Validation Token’ stage for a brief period after Regenerate button is clicked. Once a new TXT record challenge is issued, the state changes to Pending. |
| Internal error | If you see this error, retry by clicking the **Refresh** or **Regenerate** buttons. If you're still experiencing issues, raise a support request. |

> [!NOTE]
> 1. The default TTL for TXT record is 1 hour. When you need to regenerate the TXT record for re-validation, please pay attention to the TTL for the previous TXT record. If it doesn't expire, the validation will fail until the previous TXT record expires. 
> 2. If the **Regenerate** button doesn't work, delete and recreate the domain.
> 3. If the domain state doesn't reflect as expected, select the **Refresh** button.

## Associate the custom domain with your Front Door Endpoint

After you've validated your custom domain, you can then add it to your Azure Front Door Standard/Premium endpoint.

1. Once custom domain is validated, you can associate it to an existing Azure Front Door endpoint and route. Select the **Unassociated** link to open the **Associate endpoint and routes** page. Select an endpoint and routes you want to associate with. Then select **Associate**. Close the page once the associate operation completes.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/associate-endpoint-routes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of associate endpoint and routes page.":::

    The Endpoint association status should change to reflect the endpoint to which the custom domain is currently associated. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/endpoint-association-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of endpoint association link.":::

1. Select the DNS state link.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/dns-state-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of DNS state link.":::

1. The **Add or update the CNAME record** page will appear and display the CNAME record information that must be provided before traffic can start flowing. If you're using Azure DNS hosted zones, the CNAME records can be created by selecting the **Add** button on the page. If you're using another DNS provider, you must manually enter the CNAME record name and value as shown on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-update-cname-record.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add or update CNAME record.":::

1. Once the CNAME record gets created and the custom domain is associated to the Azure Front Door endpoint completes, traffic flow will start flowing.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If HTTPS is enabled, certificate provisioning and propagation may take a few minutes because propagation is being done to all edge locations.

## Verify the custom domain

After you've validated and associated the custom domain, verify that the custom domain is correctly referenced to your endpoint.

Then lastly, validate that your application content is getting served using a browser.
