# Cache purging in Azure Front Door

Azure Front Door caches assets until the asset's time-to-live (TTL) expires. Whenever a client requests an asset with expired TTL, the Azure Front Door environment retrieves a new updated copy of the asset to serve the request and then stores the refreshed cache.

Best practice is to make sure your users always obtain the latest copy of your assets. The way to do that is to version your assets for each update and publish them as new URLs. Azure Front Door Standard/Premium will immediately retrieve the new assets for the next client requests. Sometimes you may wish to purge cached contents from all edge nodes and force them all to retrieve new updated assets. The reason you want to purge cached contents is because you've made new updates to your application, or you want to update assets that contain incorrect information.

## Prerequisites

Review [Caching with Azure Front Door](../front-door-caching.md) to understand how caching works.

## Configure cache purge

1. Go to the overview page of your Azure Front Door profile with assets you want to purge, then select **Purge cache**.

1. Select one or more endpoints and enter the domain and or subdomains you want to purge from the edge nodes.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Cache purge for wildcard domains is not supported, you have to specify a subdomain for cache purge for a wildcard domain. You can add as many single-level subdomains of the wildcard domain. For example, for the wildcard domain `*.afdxgatest.azfdtest.xyz`, you can add subdomains in the form of `contoso.afdxgatest.azfdtest.xyz` or `cart.afdxgatest.azfdtest.xyz` and so on. For more information, see [Wildcard domains in Azure Front Door](../front-door-wildcard-domain.md).

   :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-cache-purge/purge-cache-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the purge cache page.":::

1. To clear all assets, select **Purge all assets for the selected domains**. Otherwise, in **Paths**, enter the path of each asset you want to purge.

These formats are supported in the lists of paths to purge:

* **Single path purge**: Purge individual assets by specifying the full path of the asset (without the protocol and domain), with the file extension, for example, /pictures/strasbourg.png.
* **Root domain purge**: Purge the root of the endpoint with "/*" in the path.

Cache purges on the Azure Front Door profile are case-insensitive. Additionally, they're query string agnostic, which means to purge a URL will purge all query-string variations of it.
