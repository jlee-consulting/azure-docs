## Databases

### Replication - Add a primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one

Based on our internal monitoring, we have observed significant replication lag on your replica server. This lag is occurring because the replica server is replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key. To ensure that the replica can synchronize with the primary and keep up with changes, add primary keys to the tables in the primary server. Once the primary keys are added, recreate the replica server.

Learn more about [Azure Database for MySQL flexible server - MySqlFlexibleServerReplicaMissingPKfb41 (Replication - Add a primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one)](/azure/mysql/how-to-troubleshoot-replication-latency#no-primary-key-or-unique-key-on-a-table).

### High Availability - Add primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one

Our internal monitoring system has identified significant replication lag on the High Availability standby server. The standby server replaying relay logs on a table that lacks a primary key, is the main cause of the lag. To address this issue and adhere to best practices, we recommend you add primary keys to all tables. Once you add the primary keys, proceed to disable and then re-enable High Availability to mitigate the problem.

Learn more about [Azure Database for MySQL flexible server - MySqlFlexibleServerHAMissingPKcf38 (High Availability - Add primary key to the table that currently doesn't have one.)](/azure/mysql/how-to-troubleshoot-replication-latency#no-primary-key-or-unique-key-on-a-table).

### Availability might be impacted from high memory fragmentation. Increase fragmentation memory reservation to avoid

Fragmentation and memory pressure can cause availability incidents during a failover or management operations. Increasing reservation of memory for fragmentation helps in reducing the cache failures when running under high memory pressure. Memory for fragmentation can be increased with the maxfragmentationmemory-reserved setting available in the advanced settings option area.

### Your Azure Cosmos DB account is unable to access its linked Azure Key Vault hosting your encryption key

It appears that your key vault's configuration is preventing your Azure Cosmos DB account from contacting the key vault to access your managed encryption keys. If you've recently performed a key rotation, make sure that the previous key or key version remains enabled and available until Azure Cosmos DB has completed the rotation. The previous key or key version can be disabled after 24 hours, or after the Azure Key Vault audit logs don't show activity from Azure Cosmos DB on that key or key version anymore.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBKeyVaultWrap (Your Azure Cosmos DB account is unable to access its linked Azure Key Vault hosting your encryption key)](../cosmos-db/how-to-setup-cmk.md).

### Avoid being rate limited from metadata operations

We found a high number of metadata operations on your account. Your data in Azure Cosmos DB, including metadata about your databases and collections, is distributed across partitions. Metadata operations have a system-reserved request unit (RU) limit. A high number of metadata operations can cause rate limiting. Avoid rate limiting by using static Azure Cosmos DB client instances in your code, and caching the names of databases and collections.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBHighMetadataOperations (Avoid being rate limited from metadata operations)](/azure/cosmos-db/performance-tips).

### SSL/TLS renegotiation blocked

SSL/TLS renegotiation attempt blocked. Renegotiation happens when a client certificate is requested over an already established connection. When it's blocked, reading 'context.Request.Certificate' in policy expressions returns 'null.' To support client certificate authentication scenarios, enable 'Negotiate client certificate' on listed hostnames. For browser-based clients, enabling this option might result in a certificate prompt being presented to the client.

### Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity

Try to avoid overriding the hostname when configuring Application Gateway.  Having a domain on the frontend of Application Gateway different than the one used to access the backend, can potentially lead to cookies or redirect URLs being broken. A different frontend domain isn't a problem in all situations, and certain categories of backends like REST APIs, are less sensitive in general.  Make sure the backend is able to deal with the domain difference, or update the Application Gateway configuration so the hostname doesn't need to be overwritten towards the backend.  When used with App Service, attach a custom domain name to the Web App and avoid use of the `*.azurewebsites.net` host name towards the backend.

Learn more about [Application gateway - AppGatewayHostOverride (Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity)](https://aka.ms/appgw-advisor-usecustomdomain).

### Implement ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance Monitor for end-to-end monitoring of your ExpressRoute circuit

We have detected that ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance Monitor isn't currently monitoring your ExpressRoute circuit. ExpressRoute monitor provides end-to-end monitoring capabilities including: loss, latency, and performance from on-premises to Azure and Azure to on-premises

Learn more about [ExpressRoute circuit - ExpressRouteGatewayE2EMonitoring (Implement ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance Monitor for end-to-end monitoring of your ExpressRoute circuit)](../expressroute/how-to-npm.md).

### Use ExpressRoute Global Reach to improve your design for disaster recovery

You appear to have ExpressRoute circuits peered in at least two different locations. Connect them to each other using ExpressRoute Global Reach to allow traffic to continue flowing between your on-premises network and Azure environments if one circuit losing connectivity. You can establish Global Reach connections between circuits in different peering locations within the same metro or across metros.

Learn more about [ExpressRoute circuit - UseGlobalReachForDR (Use ExpressRoute Global Reach to improve your design for disaster recovery)](../expressroute/about-upgrade-circuit-bandwidth.md).

### Add at least one more endpoint to the profile, preferably in another Azure region

Profiles require more than one endpoint to ensure availability if one of the endpoints fails. We also recommend that endpoints be in different regions.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - GeneralProfile (Add at least one more endpoint to the profile, preferably in another Azure region)](https://aka.ms/AA1o0x4).

### Add an endpoint configured to "All (World)"

For geographic routing, traffic is routed to endpoints based on defined regions. When a region fails, there's no predefined failover. Having an endpoint where the Regional Grouping is configured to "All (World)" for geographic profiles avoids traffic black holing and guarantee service remains available.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - GeographicProfile (Add an endpoint configured to \""All (World)\"")](https://aka.ms/Rf7vc5).

### Add or move one endpoint to another Azure region

All endpoints associated to this proximity profile are in the same region. Users from other regions might experience long latency when attempting to connect. Adding or moving an endpoint to another region improves overall performance for proximity routing and provide better availability in case all endpoints in one region fail.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - ProximityProfile (Add or move one endpoint to another Azure region)](https://aka.ms/Ldkkdb).

### Move to production gateway SKUs from Basic gateways

The VPN gateway Basic SKU is designed for development or testing scenarios. Move to a production SKU if you're using the VPN gateway for production purposes.

### Update virtual network permission of Application Gateway users

To improve security and provide a more consistent experience across Azure, all users must pass a permission check before creating or updating an Application Gateway in a Virtual Network. The users or service principals must include at least Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action permission.

Learn more about [Application gateway - AppGwLinkedAccessFailureRecmmendation (Update VNet permission of Application Gateway users)](https://aka.ms/agsubnetjoin).

### Use version-less Key Vault secret identifier to reference the certificates

We strongly recommend that you use a version-less secret identifier to allow your application gateway resource to automatically retrieve the new certificate version, whenever available. Example: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/

Learn more about [Application gateway - AppGwAdvisorRecommendationForCertificateUpdate (Use version-less Key Vault secret identifier to reference the certificates)](https://aka.ms/agkvversion).

### Enable Active-Active gateways for redundancy

In active-active configuration, both instances of the VPN gateway establish S2S VPN tunnels to your on-premises VPN device. When a planned maintenance or unplanned event happens to one gateway instance, traffic is switched over to the other active IPsec tunnel automatically.

Learn more about [Virtual network gateway - VNetGatewayActiveActive (Enable Active-Active gateways for redundancy)](https://aka.ms/aa_vpnha_learnmore).

<!--
### Use HEAD health probes

For health probes, itâ€™s a good practice to use the HEAD method, which reduces the amount of traffic load on your origins.

Learn more about [Front Door - Use HEAD health probes](https://aka.ms/afd-use-health-probes).
-->
### Use managed TLS certificates

Front Door management of your TLS certificates reduces your operational costs and helps you to avoid costly outages caused by forgetting to renew a certificate.

Learn more about [Use managed TLS certificates](https://aka.ms/afd-use-managed-tls).

### Disable health probes when there is only one origin in an origin group

If you only have a single origin, Front Door always routes traffic to that origin even if its health probe reports an unhealthy status. The status of the health probe doesn't do anything to change Front Door's behavior. In this scenario, health probes don't provide a benefit and you should disable them to reduce the traffic on your origin.

Learn more about [Health probe best practices](https://aka.ms/afd-disable-health-probes).

### Use the same domain name on Azure Front Door and your origin

We recommend that you preserve the original HTTP host name when you use a reverse proxy in front of a web application. Having a different host name at the reverse proxy than the one that's provided to the back-end application server can lead to cookies or redirect URLs that don't work properly. For example, session state can get lost, authentication can fail, or back-end URLs can inadvertently be exposed to end users. You can avoid these problems by preserving the host name of the initial request so that the application server sees the same domain as the web browser.

Learn more about [Use the same domain name on Azure Front Door and your origin](https://aka.ms/afd-same-domain-origin).
