### Review the configuration of your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account

Your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account currently contains resources with a total provisioned throughput exceeding 1,000 Request Units per second (RU/s). Because the free tier only covers the first 1000 RU/s of throughput provisioned across your account, any throughput beyond 1000 RU/s is billed at the regular pricing. As a result, we anticipate that you're charged for the throughput currently provisioned on your Azure Cosmos DB account.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBFreeTierOverage (Review the configuration of your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account)](../cosmos-db/understand-your-bill.md#azure-free-tier).

### Enable autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container

Based on your usage in the past seven days, you can save by enabling autoscale. For each hour, we compared the RU/s provisioned to the actual utilization of the RU/s (what autoscale would have scaled to) and calculated the cost savings across the time period. Autoscale helps optimize your cost by scaling down RU/s when not in use.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBAutoscaleRecommendations (Enable autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container)](../cosmos-db/provision-throughput-autoscale.md).

### Configure manual throughput instead of autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container

### Purchasing a savings plan for compute could unlock lower prices

We analyzed your compute usage over the last 30 days and recommend adding a savings plan to increase your savings. The savings plan unlocks lower prices on select compute services when you commit to spend a fixed hourly amount for 1 or 3 years. As you use select compute services globally, your usage is covered by the plan at reduced prices. During the times when your usage is above your hourly commitment, you’ll simply be billed at your regular pay-as-you-go prices. With savings automatically applying across compute usage globally, you’ll continue saving even as your usage needs change over time. Savings plan are more suited for dynamic workloads while accommodating for planned or unplanned changes while reservations are more suited for stable, predictable workloads with no planned changes. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions and the usage pattern observed over last 30 days. Shared scope savings plans are available in purchase experience and can further increase savings.

### Purchasing a savings plan for compute could unlock lower prices

We analyzed your compute usage over the last 30 days and recommend adding a savings plan to increase your savings. The savings plan unlocks lower prices on select compute services when you commit to spend a fixed hourly amount for one or three years. As you use select compute services globally, your usage is covered by the plan at reduced prices. During the times when your usage is above your hourly commitment, you’ll be billed at your regular pay-as-you-go prices. With savings automatically applying across compute usage globally, you’ll continue saving even as your usage needs change over time. Savings plan are more suited for dynamic workloads while accommodating for planned or unplanned changes while reservations are more suited for stable, predictable workloads with no planned changes. Saving estimates are calculated for individual subscriptions and the usage pattern observed over last 30 days. Shared scope savings plans are available in purchase experience and can further increase savings.

## Storage

### Use Standard Storage to store Managed Disks snapshots

To save 60% of cost, store your snapshots in Standard Storage, regardless of the storage type of the parent disk. It is the default option for Managed Disks snapshots. Migrate your snapshot from Premium to Standard Storage. Refer to Managed Disks pricing details.

### Revisit retention policy for classic log data in storage accounts

Large classic log data is detected on your storage accounts. You're billed on capacity of data stored in storage accounts including classic logs. Check the retention policy of classic logs and update with necessary period to retain less log data. This would reduce unnecessary classic log data and save your billing cost from less capacity.

### Based on your high transactions/TB  ratio, premium storage might be more cost effective

Your transactions/TB ratio might be high. Exact number would depend on transaction mix and region but anywhere over 30 or 35 TPB/TB are good candidates to evaluate a move to Premium storage.

### Use differential or incremental backup for database workloads

For SQL/HANA DBs in Azure VMs being backed up to Azure, using daily differential with weekly full backup is often more cost-effective than daily fully backups. For HANA, Azure Backup also supports incremental backup that is even more cost effective.

### Right-size underutilized App Service plans

We've analyzed the usage patterns of your App Service plan over the past seven days and identified low CPU usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can save money by choosing a less expensive SKU while retaining the same features.

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, this recommendation only works for App Service plans running on Windows on a SKU that allows you to downscale to less expensive tiers without losing any features, like from P3v2 to P2v2 or from P2v2 to P1v2. 
> - CPU bursts that last only a few minutes might not be correctly detected. Perform a careful analysis in your App Service plan metrics blade before downscaling your SKU.

### Unused/Empty App Service plans

Your App Service plan does not have any running applications associated with it. Consider deleting the resource to reduce expenses, or add new applications under it to utilize its capabilities.
