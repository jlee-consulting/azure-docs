## Desktop Virtualization

### Improve user experience and connectivity by deploying VMs closer to user’s location.

We have determined that your VMs are located in a region different or far from where your users are connecting from, using Azure Virtual Desktop. This may lead to prolonged connection response times and will impact overall user experience on Azure Virtual Desktop. When creating VMs for your host pools, you should attempt to use a region closer to the user. Having close proximity ensures continuing satisfaction with the Azure Virtual Desktop service and a better overall quality of experience.

Learn more about [Host Pool - RegionProximityHostPools (Improve user experience and connectivity by deploying VMs closer to user’s location.)](../virtual-desktop/connection-latency.md).

### Change the max session limit for your depth first load balanced host pool to improve VM performance

Depth first load balancing uses the max session limit to determine the maximum number of users that can have concurrent sessions on a single session host. If the max session limit is too high, all user sessions will be directed to the same session host and this may cause performance and reliability issues. Therefore, when setting a host pool to have depth first load balancing, you should also set an appropriate max session limit according to the configuration of your deployment and capacity of your VMs. To fix this, open your host pool's properties and change the value next to the "Max session limit" setting.

Learn more about [Host Pool - ChangeMaxSessionLimitForDepthFirstHostPool (Change the max session limit for your depth first load balanced host pool to improve VM performance )](../virtual-desktop/configure-host-pool-load-balancing.md).

## Cosmos DB

### Configure your Azure Cosmos DB applications to use Direct connectivity in the SDK

Learn more about [Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBQueryPageSize (Configure your Azure Cosmos DB query page size (MaxItemCount) to -1)](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-query-metrics#max-item-count).

### Add composite indexes to your Azure Cosmos DB container

Your Azure Cosmos DB containers are running ORDER BY queries incurring high Request Unit (RU) charges. It is recommended to add composite indexes to your containers' indexing policy to improve the RU consumption and decrease the latency of these queries.

Learn more about [Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBOrderByHighRUCharge (Add composite indexes to your Azure Cosmos DB container)](../cosmos-db/index-policy.md#composite-indexes).

### Optimize your Azure Cosmos DB indexing policy to only index what's needed

Your Azure Cosmos DB containers are using the default indexing policy, which indexes every property in your documents. Because you're storing large documents, a high number of properties get indexed, resulting in high Request Unit consumption and poor write latency. To optimize write performance, we recommend overriding the default indexing policy to only index the properties used in your queries.

Learn more about [Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBDefaultIndexingWithManyPaths (Optimize your Azure Cosmos DB indexing policy to only index what's needed)](../cosmos-db/index-policy.md).

### Use hierarchical partition keys for optimal data distribution

This account has a custom setting that allows the logical partition size in a container to exceed the limit of 20 GB. This setting was applied by the Azure Cosmos DB team as a temporary measure to give you time to re-architect your application with a different partition key. It is not recommended as a long-term solution, as SLA guarantees are not honored when the limit is increased. You can now use hierarchical partition keys (preview) to re-architect your application. The feature allows you to exceed the 20 GB limit by setting up to three partition keys, ideal for multi-tenant scenarios or workloads that use synthetic keys.

Learn more about [Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBHierarchicalPartitionKey (Use hierarchical partition keys for optimal data distribution)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/hierarchical-partition-keys-private-preview/).

## HDInsight

### Reads happen on most recent data

More than 75% of your read requests are landing on the memstore. That indicates that the reads are primarily on recent data. This suggests that even if a flush happens on the memstore, the recent file needs to be accessed and that file needs to be in the cache.

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - HBaseMemstoreReadPercentage (Reads happen on most recent data)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-advisor.md).

### Consider using Accelerated Writes feature in your HBase cluster to improve cluster performance.

You are seeing this advisor recommendation because HDInsight team's system log shows that in the past 7 days, your cluster has encountered the following scenarios:
	1. High WAL sync time latency
	2. High write request count (at least 3 one hour windows of over 1000 avg_write_requests/second/node)

These conditions are indicators that your cluster is suffering from high write latencies. This could be due to heavy workload performed on your cluster.
To improve the performance of your cluster, you may want to consider utilizing the Accelerated Writes feature provided by Azure HDInsight HBase.  The Accelerated Writes feature for HDInsight Apache HBase clusters attaches premium SSD-managed disks to every RegionServer (worker node) instead of using cloud storage. As a result, provides low write-latency and better resiliency for your applications.

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - AccWriteCandidate (Consider using Accelerated Writes feature in your HBase cluster to improve cluster performance.)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-accelerated-writes.md).

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - ScanQueryTuningcandidate (More than 75% of your queries are full scan queries.)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-advisor.md).

### Check your region counts as you have blocking updates.

Region counts needs to be adjusted to avoid updates getting blocked. It might require a scale up of the cluster by adding new nodes.

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - RegionCountCandidate (Check your region counts as you have blocking updates.)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-advisor.md).

### Consider increasing the flusher threads

The flush queue size in your region servers is more than 100 or there are updates getting blocked frequently. Tuning of the flush handler is recommended.

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - FlushQueueCandidate (Consider increasing the flusher threads)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-advisor.md).

### Consider increasing your compaction threads for compactions to complete faster

The compaction queue in your region servers is more than 2000 suggesting that more data requires compaction. Slower compactions can impact read performance as the number of files to read are more. More files without compaction can also impact the heap usage related to how files interact with Azure file system.

Learn more about [HDInsight cluster - CompactionQueueCandidate (Consider increasing your compaction threads for compactions to complete faster)](../hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-advisor.md).

### Tables with Clustered Columnstore Indexes (CCI) with less than 60 million rows

Clustered columnstore tables are organized in data into segments. Having high segment quality is critical to achieving optimal query performance on a columnstore table. Segment quality can be measured by the number of rows in a compressed row group.
