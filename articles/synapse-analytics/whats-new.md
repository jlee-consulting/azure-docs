The [Azure Synapse Link for SQL preview has been announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-azure-synapse-link-for-sql/ba-p/3372986). For more information, see [Blog: Azure Synapse Link for SQL Deep Dive](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/synapse-link-for-sql-deep-dive/ba-p/3567645).|

## Synapse SQL

This section summarizes recent improvements and features in SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics.

|**Month** | **Feature** |  **Learn more**|
|:-- |:-- | :-- |
| September 2022 | **Auto-statistics for OPENROWSET in CSV datasets** | Serverless SQL pool will [automatically create statistics](sql/develop-tables-statistics.md#statistics-in-serverless-sql-pool) for CSV datasets when needed to ensure an optimal query execution plan for OPENROWSET queries. |
| September 2022 | **MERGE T-SQL syntax** | [T-SQL MERGE syntax](/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) has been a highly requested addition to the Synapse T-SQL library. MERGE encapsulates INSERTs/UPDATEs/DELETEs into a single statement. Available in dedicated SQL pools in version 10.0.17829 and above. For more, see the [MERGE T-SQL announcement blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/merge-t-sql-for-dedicated-sql-pools-is-now-ga/ba-p/3634331).|
| August 2022| **Apache Spark Delta Lake tables in serverless SQL pools** | The ability to for serverless SQL pools to access Delta Lake tables created in Spark databases is in preview. For more information, see [Azure Synapse Analytics shared metadata tables](metadata/table.md).|
| August 2022| **Multi-column distribution in dedicated SQL pools** | You can now Hash Distribute tables on multiple columns for a more even distribution of the base table, reducing data skew over time and improving query performance. For more information on opting-in to the preview, see [CREATE TABLE distribution options](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-azure-sql-data-warehouse#TableDistributionOptions) or [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT distribution options](/sql/t-sql/statements/create-table-as-select-azure-sql-data-warehouse#table-distribution-options).|
| August 2022| **Distribution Advisor**| The Distribution Advisor is a new preview feature in Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pools Gen2 that analyzes queries and recommends the best distribution strategies for tables to improve query performance. For more information, see [Distribution Advisor in Azure Synapse SQL](sql/distribution-advisor.md).|
| August 2022 | **Add SQL objects and users in Lake databases** | New capabilities announced for lake databases in serverless SQL pools: create schemas, views, procedures, inline table-valued functions. You can also database users from your Azure Active Directory domain and assign them to the db_datareader role. For more information, see [Access lake databases using serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics](metadata/database.md#custom-sql-objects-in-lake-databases) and [Create and use native external tables using SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics](sql/create-use-external-tables.md).|
| June 2022 | **Result set size limit increase** | The [maximum size of query result sets](./sql/resources-self-help-sql-on-demand.md?tabs=x80070002#constraints) in serverless SQL pools has been increased from 200 GB to 400 GB.  |
| May 2022 | **Automatic character column length calculation for serverless SQL pools** | It's no longer necessary to define character column lengths for serverless SQL pools in the data lake. You can get optimal query performance [without having to define the schema](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/azure-synapse-analytics-may-update-2022/ba-p/3430970#TOCREF_4), because the serverless SQL pool will use automatically calculated average column lengths and cardinality estimation. |
| April 2022 | **Cross-subscription restore for Azure Synapse SQL GA** | With the PowerShell `Az.Sql` module 3.8 update, the [Restore-AzSqlDatabase](/powershell/module/az.sql/restore-azsqldatabase) cmdlet can be used for cross-subscription restore of dedicated SQL pools. To learn more, see [Restore a dedicated SQL pool to a different subscription](sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-restore-active-paused-dw.md#restore-an-existing-dedicated-sql-pool-formerly-sql-dw-to-a-different-subscription-through-powershell). This feature is now generally available for dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) and dedicated SQL pools in a Synapse workspace. [What's the difference?](https://aka.ms/dedicatedSQLpooldiff)|
| April 2022 | **Recover SQL pool from dropped server or workspace** | With the PowerShell Restore cmdlets in `Az.Sql` and `Az.Synapse` modules, you can now restore from a deleted server or workspace without filing a support ticket. For more information, see [Restore a dedicated SQL pool from a deleted Azure Synapse workspace](backuprestore/restore-sql-pool-from-deleted-workspace.md) or [Restore a standalone dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) from a deleted server](backuprestore/restore-sql-pool-from-deleted-workspace.md), depending on your scenario.  |
| March 2022 | **Column level encryption for dedicated SQL pools** | [Column level encryption](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/encrypt-a-column-of-data?view=azure-sqldw-latest&preserve-view=true) is now generally available for use on new and existing Azure SQL logical servers with Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pools, as well as the dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse workspaces. SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) support for column level encryption for the dedicated SQL pools is available starting with the 17.2 Preview 2 build of Visual Studio 2022.|
| March 2022 | **Parallel execution for CETAS** | Better performance for [CREATE TABLE AS SELECT](sql/develop-tables-cetas.md) (CETAS) and subsequent SELECT statements now made possible by use of parallel execution plans. For examples, see [Better performance for CETAS and subsequent SELECTs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/azure-synapse-analytics-march-update-2022/ba-p/3269194#TOCREF_7).|
