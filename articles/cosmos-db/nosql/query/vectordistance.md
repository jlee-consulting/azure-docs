# VectorDistance (NoSQL query)

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

Returns the similarity score between two specified vectors.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Geospatial and GeoJSON location data](geospatial-intro.md).

## Syntax

```nosql
VECTORDISTANCE(<vector_expr1>, <vector_expr2>, [<bool_expr>], [<obj_expr>])  
```

## Arguments

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`spatial_expr_1`** | An array of `float32` or smaller.|
| **`spatial_expr_2`** | An array of `float32` or smaller.|
| **`bool_expr`** | A boolean specifying how the computed value is used in an ORDER BY expression. If `true`, then brute force is used. A value of `false` leverages any index defined on the vector property, if it exists. Default value is `false`.|
|**`obj_expr`**| A JSON formatted object literal used to specify options for the vector distance calculation. Valid items include `distanceFunction` and `dataType`.|
| **`distanceFunction`** | The metric used to compute distance/similarity.
| **`dataType`** | The data type of the vectors. `float32`, `int8`, `uint8` values. Default value is `float32`. |


Supported metrics for `distanceFunction` are: 
   *  [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), which has values from -1 (least similar) to +1 (most similar).  
   *  [dotproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product), which has values from -inf (least similar) to +inf (most similar).
   *  [euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), which has values from 0 (most similar) to +inf (least similar).

## Return types

Returns a numeric expression that enumerates the similarity score between two expressions.

## Examples

### With required arguments
```sql
SELECT c.name, VectorDistance(c.vector1, c.vector2) AS SimilarityScore
FROM c
ORDER BY VectorDistance(c.vector1, c.vector2)
```

### With optional arguments
```sql
SELECT c.name, VectorDistance(c.vector1, c.vector2, true, {'distanceFunction':'cosine', 'dataType':'float32',}) AS SimilarityScore
FROM c
ORDER BY VectorDistance(c.vector1, c.vector2)
```

## Remarks
- This function requires enrollment in the [Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Vector Search preview feature](../vector-search.md#enroll-in-the-vector-search-preview-feature).
- This function benefits from a [vector index](../../index-policy.md#vector-indexes)
- if `false` is given as the optional `bool_expr`, then the vector index defined on the path is used, if one exists. If no index is defined on the vector path, then this reverts to full scan and incurs higher RU charges and higher latency than if using a vector index. 
- When `VectorDistance` is used in an `ORDER BY` clause, no direction needs to be specified for the `ORDER BY` as the results are always sorted in order of most similar (first) to least similar (last) based on the similarity metric used.
- The result is expressed as a similarity score.
