# Quickstart: Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB driver for Node.js

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Developer Quickstart selector](includes/quickstart-dev-selector.md)]

Get started with the MongoDB npm package to create databases, collections, and docs within your Azure Cosmos DB resource. Follow these steps to  install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

[API for MongoDB reference documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp) | [MongoDB Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver)
packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) | [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Developer Quickstart prerequisites](includes/quickstart-dev-prereqs.md)]

## Setting up

Deploy this project's development container to your environment. Then, use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to create an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account and deploy a containerized sample application. The sample application uses the client library to manage, create, read, and query sample data.

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.

1. Authenticate to the Azure Developer CLI using `azd auth login`. Follow the steps specified by the tool to authenticate to the CLI using your preferred Azure credentials.

    ```azurecli
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Use `azd init` to initialize the project.

    ```azurecli
    azd init --template cosmos-db-mongodb-nodejs-quickstart
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This quickstart uses the [azure-samples/cosmos-db-mongodb-nodejs-quickstart](https://github.com/azure-samples/cosmos-db-mongodb-nodejs-quickstart) template GitHub repository. The Azure Developer CLI will automatically clone this project to your machine if it is not already there.

1. During initialization, configure a unique environment name.

    > [!TIP]
    > The environment name will also be used as the target resource group name. For this quickstart, consider using `msdocs-cosmos-db`.

1. Deploy the Azure Cosmos DB account using `azd up`. The Bicep templates also deploy a sample web application.

    ```azurecli
    azd up
    ```

1. During the provisioning process, select your subscription and desired location. Wait for the provisioning process to complete. The process can take **approximately five minutes**.

1. Once the provisioning of your Azure resources is done, a URL to the running web application is included in the output.

    ```output
    Deploying services (azd deploy)
    
      (âœ“) Done: Deploying service web
    - Endpoint: <https://[container-app-sub-domain].azurecontainerapps.io>
    
    SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned and deployed to Azure in 5 minutes 0 seconds.
    ```

1. Use the URL in the console to navigate to your web application in the browser. Observe the output of the running app.

### Install the package

Add the [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) npm package to the JavaScript project. Use the [``npm install package``](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) command specifying the name of the npm package. The `dotenv` package is used to read the environment variables from a `.env` file during local development.

```console
npm install mongodb dotenv
```

## Object model

Before you start building the application, let's look into the hierarchy of resources in Azure Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB has a specific object model used to create and access resources. The Azure Cosmos DB creates resources in a hierarchy that consists of accounts, databases, collections, and docs.

:::image type="complex" source="media/quickstart-nodejs/resource-hierarchy.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Azure Cosmos DB hierarchy including accounts, databases, collections, and docs.":::

The other database shard includes a single child collection node. That single collection shard has three child doc shards.
:::image-end:::

You use the following MongoDB classes to interact with these resources:

- [``MongoClient``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/MongoClient.html) - This class provides a client-side logical representation for the API for MongoDB layer on Azure Cosmos DB. The client object is used to configure and execute requests against the service.
- [``Db``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/Db.html) - This class is a reference to a database that might, or might not, exist in the service yet. The database is validated server-side when you attempt to access it or perform an operation against it.
- [``Collection``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/Collection.html) - This class is a reference to a collection that also might not exist in the service yet. The collection is validated server-side when you attempt to work with it.

## Code examples

- [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
- [Get database instance](#get-database-instance)
- [Get collection instance](#get-collection-instance)
- [Use chained methods](#chained-instances)
- [Create an index](#create-an-index)
- [Create a doc](#create-a-doc)
- [Get an doc](#get-a-doc)
- [Run queries](#query-docs)

The sample code described in this article creates a database named ``adventureworks`` with a collection named ``products``. The ``products`` collection is designed to contain product details such as name, category, quantity, and a sale indicator. Each product also contains a unique identifier.

For this procedure, the database doesn't use sharding.

### Authenticate the client

1. From the project directory, create an *index.js* file. In your editor, add requires statements to reference the MongoDB and DotEnv npm packages.

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="package_dependencies":::

2. Define a new instance of the ``MongoClient,`` class using the constructor, and [``process.env.``](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_env) to read the environment variable you created earlier.

    :::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="client_credentials":::

For more information on different ways to create a ``MongoClient`` instance, see [MongoDB NodeJS Driver Quick Start](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb#quick-start).

### Set up asynchronous operations

In the ``index.js`` file, add the following code to support the asynchronous operations:

```javascript
async function main(){

// The remaining operations are added here
// in the main function

}

main()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => client.close());
```

The following code snippets should be added into the *main* function in order to handle the async/await syntax.

### Connect to the database

Use the [``MongoClient.connect``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/MongoClient.html#connect) method to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB resource. The connect method returns a reference to the database.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="connect_client":::

### Get database instance

Use the [``MongoClient.db``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/MongoClient.html#db) gets a reference to a database.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="new_database" :::

### Get collection instance

The [``MongoClient.Db.collection``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/Db.html#collection) gets a reference to a collection.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="new_collection":::

### Chained instances

You can chain the client, database, and collection together. Chaining is more convenient if you need to access multiple databases or collections.

```javascript
const db = await client.db(`adventureworks`).collection('products').updateOne(query, update, options)
```

### Create an index

Use the [``Collection.createIndex``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.7/classes/Collection.html#createIndex) to create an index on the document's properties you intend to use for sorting with the MongoDB's [``FindCursor.sort``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.7/classes/FindCursor.html#sort) method.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="create_index":::

### Create a doc

Create a doc with the *product* properties for the `adventureworks` database:

- An _id property for the unique identifier of the product.
- A *category* property. This property can be used as the logical partition key.
- A *name* property.
- An inventory *quantity* property.
- A *sale* property, indicating whether the product is on sale.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="new_doc":::

Create an doc in the collection by calling [``Collection.UpdateOne``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/Collection.html#updateOne). In this example, we chose to *upsert* instead of *create* a new doc in case you run this sample code more than once.

### Get a doc

In Azure Cosmos DB, you can perform a less-expensive [point read](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/point-reads-versus-queries/) operation by using both the unique identifier (``_id``) and partition key (``category``).

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="read_doc" :::

### Query docs

After you insert a doc, you can run a query to get all docs that match a specific filter. This example finds all docs that match a specific category: `gear-surf-surfboards`. Once the query is defined, call [``Collection.find``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.5/classes/Collection.html#find) to get a [``FindCursor``](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.7/classes/FindCursor.html) result. Convert the cursor into an array to use JavaScript array methods.

:::code language="javascript" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="query_docs" :::

Troubleshooting:

- If you get an error such as `The index path corresponding to the specified order-by item is excluded.`, make sure you [created the index](#create-an-index).

## Run the code

This app creates an API for MongoDB database and collection and creates a doc and then reads the exact same doc back. Finally, the example issues a query that should only return that single doc. With each step, the example outputs information to the console about the performed steps.

To run the app, use a terminal to navigate to the application directory and run the application.

```console
node index.js
```

The output of the app should be similar to this example:

:::code language="console" source="~/samples-cosmosdb-mongodb-javascript/001-quickstart/index.js" id="console_result" :::

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account, you can delete the corresponding resource group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [``az group delete``](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to delete the resource group.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the [``Remove-AzResourceGroup``](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) cmdlet to delete the resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$parameters = @{
    Name = $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
}
Remove-AzResourceGroup @parameters
```

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to the resource group you previously created in the Azure portal.

    > [!TIP]
    > In this quickstart, we recommended the name ``msdocs-cosmos-javascript-quickstart-rg``.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
