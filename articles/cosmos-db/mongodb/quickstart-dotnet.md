# Quickstart: Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB for .NET with the MongoDB driver

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Developer Quickstart selector](includes/quickstart-dev-selector.md)]

Get started with MongoDB to create databases, collections, and docs within your Azure Cosmos DB resource. Follow these steps to deploy a minimal solution to your environment using the Azure Developer CLI.

[API for MongoDB reference documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/csharp) | [MongoDB Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver)
packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos) | [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Developer Quickstart prerequisites](includes/quickstart-dev-prereqs.md)]

## Setting up

Deploy this project's development container to your environment. Then, use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to create an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account and deploy a containerized sample application. The sample application uses the client library to manage, create, read, and query sample data.

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.

1. Authenticate to the Azure Developer CLI using `azd auth login`. Follow the steps specified by the tool to authenticate to the CLI using your preferred Azure credentials.

    ```azurecli
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Use `azd init` to initialize the project.

    ```azurecli
    azd init --template cosmos-db-mongodb-dotnet-quickstart
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This quickstart uses the [azure-samples/cosmos-db-mongodb-dotnet-quickstart](https://github.com/azure-samples/cosmos-db-mongodb-dotnet-quickstart) template GitHub repository. The Azure Developer CLI will automatically clone this project to your machine if it is not already there.

1. During initialization, configure a unique environment name.

    > [!TIP]
    > The environment name will also be used as the target resource group name. For this quickstart, consider using `msdocs-cosmos-db`.

1. Deploy the Azure Cosmos DB account using `azd up`. The Bicep templates also deploy a sample web application.

    ```azurecli
    azd up
    ```

1. During the provisioning process, select your subscription and desired location. Wait for the provisioning process to complete. The process can take **approximately five minutes**.

1. Once the provisioning of your Azure resources is done, a URL to the running web application is included in the output.

    ```output
    Deploying services (azd deploy)
    
      (âœ“) Done: Deploying service web
    - Endpoint: <https://[container-app-sub-domain].azurecontainerapps.io>
    
    SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned and deployed to Azure in 5 minutes 0 seconds.
    ```

1. Use the URL in the console to navigate to your web application in the browser. Observe the output of the running app.

### Install the client library

The client library is available through NuGet, as the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` package.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `/src/web` folder.

    ```bash
    cd ./src/web
    ```

1. If not already installed, install the `MongoDb.Driver` package using `dotnet add package`.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package MongoDb.Driver
    ```

1. Also, install the `Azure.Identity` package if not already installed.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Azure.Identity
    ```

## Object model

Before you start building the application, let's look into the hierarchy of resources in Azure Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB has a specific object model used to create and access resources. The Azure Cosmos DB creates resources in a hierarchy that consists of accounts, databases, collections, and docs.

:::image type="complex" source="media/quickstart-dotnet/resource-hierarchy.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Azure Cosmos DB hierarchy including accounts, databases, collections, and docs.":::

The other database shard includes a single child collection shard. That single collection shard has three child doc shards.
:::image-end:::

You use the following MongoDB classes to interact with these resources:

- [``MongoClient``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/T_MongoDB_Driver_MongoClient.htm) - This class provides a client-side logical representation for the API for MongoDB layer on Azure Cosmos DB. The client object is used to configure and execute requests against the service.
- [``MongoDatabase``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/T_MongoDB_Driver_MongoDatabase.htm) - This class is a reference to a database that might, or might not, exist in the service yet. The database is validated server-side when you attempt to access it or perform an operation against it.
- [``Collection``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/T_MongoDB_Driver_MongoCollection.htm) - This class is a reference to a collection that also might not exist in the service yet. The collection is validated server-side when you attempt to work with it.

## Code examples

- [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
- [Create a database](#create-a-database)
- [Create a container](#create-a-collection)
- [Create an item](#create-an-item)
- [Get an item](#get-an-item)
- [Query items](#query-items)

The sample code demonstrated in this article creates a database named ``adventureworks`` with a collection named ``products``. The ``products`` collection is designed to contain product details such as name, category, quantity, and a sale indicator. Each product also contains a unique identifier.

### Authenticate the client

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file. In your editor, add a using directive for ``MongoDB.Driver``.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="using_directives":::

Define a new instance of the ``MongoClient`` class using the constructor, and [``Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable``](/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariables) to read the connection string set by the Azure Developer CLI earlier.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs"  id="client_credentials":::

### Create a database

Use the [``MongoClient.GetDatabase``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/M_MongoDB_Driver_MongoClient_GetDatabase.htm) method to create a new database if it doesn't already exist. This method returns a reference to the existing or newly created database.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="new_database" :::

### Create a collection

The [``MongoDatabase.GetCollection``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/M_MongoDB_Driver_MongoDatabase_GetCollection.htm) creates a new collection if it doesn't already exist and return a reference to the collection.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="new_collection":::

### Create an item

The easiest way to create a new item in a collection is to create a C# [class](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class) or [record](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record) type with all of the members you want to serialize into JSON. In this example, the C# record has a unique identifier, a *category* field for the partition key, and extra *name*, *quantity*, and *sale* fields.

```csharp
public record Product(
    string Id,
    string Category,
    string Name,
    int Quantity,
    bool Sale
);
```

Create an item in the collection using the `Product` record by calling [``IMongoCollection<TDocument>.InsertOne``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/M_MongoDB_Driver_IMongoCollection_1_InsertOne_1.htm).

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="new_item" :::

### Get an item

In Azure Cosmos DB, you can retrieve items by composing queries using Linq. In the SDK, call [``IMongoCollection.FindAsync<>``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/M_MongoDB_Driver_IMongoCollection_1_FindAsync__1.htm) and pass in a C# expression to filter the results.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="read_item" :::

### Query items

After you insert an item, you can run a query to get all items that match a specific filter by treating the collection as an `IQueryable`. This example uses an expression to filter products by category. Once the call to `AsQueryable`  is made, call [``MongoQueryable.Where``](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.16/apidocs/html/M_MongoDB_Driver_Linq_MongoQueryable_Where__1.htm) to retrieve a set of filtered items.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-cosmos-mongodb-dotnet/001-quickstart/Program.cs" id="query_items" :::

## Run the code

This app creates an Azure Cosmos DB MongoDb API database and collection. The example then creates an item and then reads the exact same item back. Finally, the example creates a second item and then performs a query that should return multiple items. With each step, the example outputs metadata to the console about the performed steps.

To run the app, use a terminal to navigate to the application directory and run the application.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

The output of the app should be similar to this example:

```output
Single product name: 
Yamba Surfboard
Multiple products:
Yamba Surfboard
Sand Surfboard
```

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account, you can delete the corresponding resource group.

### [Azure CLI / Resource Manager template](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the [``az group delete``](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to delete the resource group.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the [``Remove-AzResourceGroup``](/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-azresourcegroup) cmdlet to delete the resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$parameters = @{
    Name = $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
}
Remove-AzResourceGroup @parameters
```

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to the resource group you previously created in the Azure portal.

    > [!TIP]
    > In this quickstart, we recommended the name ``msdocs-cosmos-quickstart-rg``.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
