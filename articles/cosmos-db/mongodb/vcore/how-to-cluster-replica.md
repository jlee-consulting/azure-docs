# Manage cross-region replication on your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster (preview)

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore allows continuous data streaming to a replica cluster in another Azure region. That capability provides cross-region disaster recovery (DR) protection and read scalability across the regions. This document serves as a quick guide for developers who want to learn how to manage cross-region replication for their clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

## Enable cross-region replication

To enable cross-region replication on a new cluster *during cluster creation*, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster](./quickstart-portal.md#create-a-cluster).
1. On the **Basics** tab, select **Enable global distribution (preview)** flag.
1. On the **Global distribution (preview)** tab, select **Enable** for the **Read replica in another region (preview)**.
1. Provide a replica cluster name in the **Read replica name** field. 
1. Select a region in the **Read replica region**. The replica cluster is hosted in the selected Azure region.
1. (optionally) Select desired network access settings for the cluster on the **Networking** tab.
1. On the **Review + create** tab, review cluster configuration details, and then select **Create**. 

> [!NOTE]
> The replica cluster is created in the same Azure subscirption and resource group as its primary cluster.

To enable cross-region replication on a new cluster *at any time after cluster creation*, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps to [create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster](./quickstart-portal.md#create-a-cluster).
1. On the **Basics** tab, select **Enable global distribution (preview)** flag.
1. Skip **Global distribution (preview)** tab. This tab is used to create a cluster replica during primary cluster provisioning.
1. Once cluster is created, on the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution (preview)**.
1. Select **Add new read replica**.
1. Provide a replica cluster name in the **Read replica name** field. 
1. Select a region in the **Read replica region**. The replica cluster is hosted in the selected Azure region.
1. Verify your selection and select the **Save** button to confirm replica creation.

## Promote a replica

To [promote a cluster replica](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion) to a read-write cluster, follow these steps:

1. Select the cluster replica you would like to promote in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Global distribution**.
1. On the **Global distribution** page, select **Promote**.
1. On the **Promote \<cluster name>** screen, double check the cluster replica's name, read the warning text, and select **Promote**.

After the cluster replica is promoted, it becomes a readable and writable cluster.

## Check cluster replication role and replication region

To check replication role of a cluster, follow these steps:
1. Select an existing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.
1. Select **Overview** page.
1. Check **Read region** (on the primary cluster) or **Write region** (on the replica cluster) value.

If **Read region** value is *Not enabled*, this cluster has cross-region replication disabled.

## Disable cross-region replication

To disable cross-region replication, follow these steps:

1. Select the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore *replica* cluster.
1. Select **Overview**.
1. [Confirm that it's a replica cluster](#check-cluster-replication-role-and-replication-region).
1. In the Azure portal, on the **Overview** page for the replica cluster, select **Delete**.
1. On the **Delete \<replica name>** screen, read the warning text, and enter cluster's name in the **Confirm the account name** field.
1. Select **Delete** to confirm deletion of the replica.

If you need to delete the primary and replica clusters, you would need to delete the replica cluster first.

## Use connection strings

You can connect to the cluster replica as you would to a regular read-write cluster. 
Follow these steps to [get the connection strings for different cases](./cross-region-replication.md#read-operations-on-cluster-replicas-and-connection-strings):

1. Select the primary cluster or its cluster replica in the portal.
1. On the cluster sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Connection strings**.
1. Copy the connection string for currently selected cluster to connect to that cluster.

Connection strings are preserved after [the cluster replica promotion](./cross-region-replication.md#replica-cluster-promotion). You can continue to use either string for read operations. You need to change connection string to point to the promoted replica cluster to continue writes to the database after promotion is completed.

## Cross-region replication limits and limitations
The following section describes various limits in the cross-region replication feature.

- Cross-region replication isn't supported in [the Free tier](./free-tier.md).
- [Burstable compute](./burstable-tier.md) isn't supported on replica clusters.
- Cross-region replication is supported only on clusters with one shard.
- Compute, storage, and shard count configuration is the same on the primary and replica clusters and can't be changed.
- High availability isn't supported on replica clusters.
- Replica of a replica cluster isn't supported.
