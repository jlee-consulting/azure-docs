# Prevent rate-limiting errors for Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB operations
[!INCLUDE[MongoDB](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB operations might encounter rate-limiting, resulting in 16500 errors in mongo request metrics, if they exceed a collection's throughput limit (RUs).

Enable Server Side Retry (SSR) to automate operation retries. SSR retries requests across all collections in your account with short delays. If a 60-second timeout is reached, a client receives an [ExceededTimeLimit exception (50)](error-codes-solutions.md).

## Use the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account.

1. Go to the **Features** pane underneath the **Settings** section.

1. Select **Server Side Retry**.

1. Click **Enable** to enable this feature for all collections in your account.

## Use the Azure CLI

1. Check if SSR is already enabled for your account:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az cosmosdb show --name accountname --resource-group resourcegroupname
   ```

1. **Enable** SSR for all collections in your database account. It may take up to 15 min for this change to take effect.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az cosmosdb update --name accountname --resource-group resourcegroupname --capabilities EnableMongo DisableRateLimitingResponses
   ```

1. The following command will **Disable** server-side retry for all collections in your database account by removing `DisableRateLimitingResponses` from the capabilities list. It may take up to 15 min for this change to take effect.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az cosmosdb update --name accountname --resource-group resourcegroupname --capabilities EnableMongo
   ```

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I monitor the effects of a server-side retry?

You can view the rate limiting errors (16500) with mongo requests metric, that are retried server-side in the Azure Cosmos DB Metrics pane. Keep in mind that these errors don't go to the client when SSR is enabled, since they are handled and retried server-side.

You can search for log entries containing *estimatedDelayFromRateLimitingInMilliseconds* in your [Azure Cosmos DB resource logs](../monitor-resource-logs.md).

### Will server-side retry affect my consistency level?

server-side retry does not affect a request's consistency. Requests are retried server-side if they are rate limited.

### Does server-side retry affect any type of error that my client might receive?

No, server-side retry only affects rate limiting errors by retrying them server-side. This feature prevents you from having to handle rate-limiting errors in the client application. All [other errors](error-codes-solutions.md) will go to the client.
