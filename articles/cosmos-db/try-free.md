# Try Azure Cosmos DB free
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-all-apis](includes/appliesto-all-apis.md)]

[Try Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb) makes it easy to try out Azure Cosmos DB for free before you commit. There's no credit card required to get started. Your account is free for 30 days. After expiration, a new sandbox account can be created. You can extend beyond 30 days for 24 hours. You can upgrade your active Try Azure Cosmos DB account at any time during the 30 day trial period. If you're using the SQL API, migrate your Try Azure Cosmos DB data to your upgraded account.
 
This article walks you through how to create your account, limits, and upgrading your account. This article also walks through how to migrate your data from your Try Azure Cosmos DB sandbox to your own account using the SQL API.

## Try Azure Cosmos DB limits

The following table lists the limits for the [Try Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb) for Free trial.

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Duration of the trial | 30 days (a new trial can be requested after expiration) After expiration, the information stored is deleted. Prior to expiration you can upgrade your account and migrate the information stored. |
| Maximum containers per subscription (SQL, Gremlin, Table API) | 1 |
| Maximum containers per subscription (MongoDB API) | 3 |
| Maximum throughput per container | 5,000 |
| Maximum throughput per shared-throughput database | 20,000 |
| Maximum total storage per account | 10 GB |

Try Azure Cosmos DB supports global distribution in only the Central US, North Europe, and Southeast Asia regions. Azure support tickets can't be created for Try Azure Cosmos DB accounts. However, support is provided for subscribers with existing support plans.

## Create your Try Azure Cosmos DB account

From the [Try Azure Cosmos DB home page](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb), select an API. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) and MongoDB for document data, Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra. 

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure which API will best meet your needs? To learn more about the APIs for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Choose an API in Azure Cosmos DB](choose-api.md).

## Launch a Quick Start

Launch the Quickstart in Data Explorer in Azure portal to start using Azure Cosmos DB or get started with our documentation. 

* [Core (SQL) API Quickstart](sql/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal.md#add-a-database-and-a-container)
* [MongoDB API Quickstart](mongodb/create-mongodb-python.md#learn-the-object-model)
* [Apache Cassandra API](cassandra/cassandra-adoption.md)
* [Gremlin (Graph) API](graph/create-graph-console.md#add-a-graph)
* [Azure Table API](table/create-table-dotnet.md)

You can also get started with one of the learning resources in Data Explorer.

## Upgrade your account

Your account is free for 30 days. After expiration, a new sandbox account can be created. You can upgrade your active Try Azure Cosmos DB account at any time during the 30 day trial period. Here are the steps to start an upgrade.

1. Select the option to upgrade your current account in the Dashboard page or from the [Try Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb) page.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/try-free/upgrade-account.png" lightbox="media/try-free/upgrade-account.png" alt-text="Confirmation page for the account upgrade experience.":::

1. Select **Sign up for Azure Account** & create an Azure Cosmos DB account.

You can migrate your database from Try Azure Cosmos DB to your new Azure account if you're utilizing the SQL API after you've signed up for an Azure account. Here are the steps to migrate.

### Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount.md)]

Navigate back to the **Upgrade** page and select **Next** to move on to the third step and move your data.

> [!NOTE]
> You can have up to one free tier Azure Cosmos DB account per Azure subscription and must opt-in when creating the account. If you do not see the option to apply the free tier discount, this means another account in the subscription has already been enabled with free tier.

### Prerequisites

* Must be using the Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API.
* Must have an active Try Azure Cosmos DB account and Azure account.
* Must have an Azure Cosmos DB account using the Core (SQL) API in your Azure account.

### Migrate your data

1. Locate your **Primary Connection string** for the Azure Cosmos DB account you created for your data. 

    1. Go to your Azure Cosmos DB Account in the Azure portal. 
    
    1. Find the connection string of your new Cosmos DB account within the **Keys** page of your new account.
