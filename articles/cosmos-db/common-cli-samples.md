# Azure CLI samples for Azure Cosmos DB API

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-table-api](includes/appliesto-table-api.md)]

The following table includes links to sample Azure CLI scripts that apply to all Cosmos DB APIs. For API specific samples, see [API specific samples](#api-specific-samples). Common samples are the same across all APIs.

These samples require Azure CLI version 2.12.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Common API Samples

These samples apply to all Azure Cosmos DB APIs. These samples use a SQL (Core) API account, but these operations are identical across all database APIs in Cosmos DB.

|Task | Description |
|---|---|
| [Add or fail over regions](scripts/cli/common/regions.md) | Add a region, change failover priority, trigger a manual failover.|
| [Perform account key operations](scripts/cli/common/keys.md)Â | List account keys, read-only keys, regenerate keys and list connection strings.|
| [Secure with IP firewall](scripts/cli/common/ipfirewall.md)| Create a Cosmos account with IP firewall configured.|
| [Secure new account with service endpoints](scripts/cli/common/service-endpoints.md)| Create a Cosmos account and secure with service-endpoints.|
| [Secure existing account with service endpoints](scripts/cli/common/service-endpoints-ignore-missing-vnet.md)| Update a Cosmos account to secure with service-endpoints when the subnet is eventually configured.|
