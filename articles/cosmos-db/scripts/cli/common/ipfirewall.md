# Create an Azure Cosmos account with IP firewall using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-all-apis](../../../includes/appliesto-all-apis.md)]

The script in this article demonstrates creating a Cosmos DB account with default values and IP Firewall enabled. It uses a SQL (Core) API account, but these operations are identical across all database APIs in Cosmos DB. To use this sample for other APIs, apply the `ip-range-filter` parameter in the script to the `az cosmosdb account create` command for your API specific script.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](../../../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](../../../../../includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/cosmosdb/common/ipfirewall.sh" id="FullScript":::

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cli-clean-up-resources.md](../../../../../includes/cli-clean-up-resources.md)]

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az cosmosdb create](/cli/azure/cosmosdb#az-cosmosdb-create) | Creates an Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
