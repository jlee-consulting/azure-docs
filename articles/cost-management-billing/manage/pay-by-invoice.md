# Pay for your Azure subscription by wire transfer

This article helps you set up your Azure subscription to pay by wire transfer.

This article applies to you if you are:

- A customer with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)
- A customer who signed up for Azure through the Azure website (for a Microsoft Online Services Program account, also called pay-as-you-go account).

If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method is already set to *wire transfer*, so these steps aren't needed.

When you switch to pay by wire transfer:
- Specify the invoice ID that you want to pay on your wire transfer.
- Send the wire payment to the designated bank as is stated on your monthly invoice.
- Send the exact amount per the invoice.
- Pay the bill by the due date.

## Prerequisites

Users with a Microsoft Customer Agreement must always [submit a request to set up pay by wire transfer](#submit-a-request-to-set-up-pay-by-wire-transfer) to Azure support to enable pay by wire transfer. Any user with access to the Microsoft Online Services Program (pay-as-you-go) billing profile can submit the request to pay by wire transfer.
