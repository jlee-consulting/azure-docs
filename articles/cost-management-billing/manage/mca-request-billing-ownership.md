# Transfer Azure product billing ownership to a Microsoft Customer Agreement

This article helps you transfer billing ownership for your Azure products (subscriptions and reservations) to a Microsoft Customer Agreement when:

- You want to move billing responsibilities for a product to a different billing owner.
- You want to transfer your Azure products from one licensing agreement to another. For example, from an Enterprise Agreement or a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement (MOSA) to a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
- You want to transfer reservation ownership.

[Check if you have access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-for-access).

The transition moves only the billing responsibility for your Azure products – the Azure resources tied to your products don't move, so the transition won't interrupt your Azure services.

This process contains the following primary tasks, which we’ll guide you through step by step:

1. Request billing ownership
2. Review and approve the transfer request
3. Check transfer request status

There are three options to transfer products:

- Transfer only subscriptions
- Transfer only reservations
- Transfer both subscriptions and reservations

When you send or accept transfer request, you agree to terms and conditions. For more information, see [Transfer terms and conditions](subscription-transfer.md#transfer-terms-and-conditions).

Before you transfer billing products, read [Supplemental information about transfers](subscription-transfer.md#supplemental-information-about-transfers).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure that the people involved in the product transfer have the required permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> To perform a transfer, the destination account must be a paid account with a valid form of payment. For example, if the destination is an Azure free account, you can upgrade it to a pay-as-you-go Azure plan under a Microsoft Customer Agreement. Then you can make the transfer.

You can also go along with the following video that outlines each step of the process for subscription transfer. However, it doesn't cover reservation transfer.

### Required permission for the transfer requestor

For both subscriptions and reservations, the product transfer requestor must have one of the following permissions:

For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, the person must have an owner or contributor role for the billing account or for the relevant billing profile or invoice section. For more information, see [Billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).

### Required permission for the subscription transfer recipient 

The subscription product owner (transfer request recipient) must have one of the following permissions:

- For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, the person must have an owner or contributor role for the billing account or for the relevant billing profile or invoice section. For more information, see [Billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).
- For an Enterprise Agreement, the person must be an account owner or EA administrator. 
- For a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement, the person must be an Account Administrator.

### Required permission for the reservation transfer recipient

The reservation product owner (transfer request recipient) must have one of the following permissions:

- For a Microsoft Customer Agreement, the person must have an owner or contributor role for the billing account or for the relevant billing profile or invoice section. For more information, see [Billing roles and tasks](understand-mca-roles.md#invoice-section-roles-and-tasks).
- For an Enterprise Agreement, the person must be an EA administrator.
- For a Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement, the person must be an Account Administrator.

## Create the product transfer request

The person creating the transfer request uses the following procedure to create the transfer request. The transfer request essentially asks the owner of the product to allow subscriptions and or reservations associated with a subscription to be transferred.

When the request is created, an email is sent to the target recipient.

The following procedure has you navigate to **Transfer requests** by selecting a **Billing scope** &gt; **Billing account** &gt; **Billing profile** &gt; **Invoice sections** to **Add a new request**. If you navigate to **Add a new request** from selecting a billing profile, you'll have to select a billing profile and then select an invoice section.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an invoice section owner or contributor for a billing account for Microsoft Customer Agreement. Use the same credentials that you used to accept your Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure portal search for Cost Management + Billing." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-search-cost-management-billing.png" :::
1. On the billing scopes page, select **Billing scopes** and then select the billing account, which would be used to pay for Azure usage in your products. Select the billing account labeled **Microsoft Customer Agreement**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-scopes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows search in portal for Cost Management + Billing." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-scopes.png" :::  
        The Azure portal remembers the last billing scope that you access and displays the scope the next time you come to Cost Management + Billing page. You won't see the billing scopes page if you have visited Cost Management + Billing earlier. If so, check that you are in the [right scope](#check-for-access). If not, [switch the scope](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal) to select the billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement.
1. Select **Billing profiles** from the left-hand side and then select a **Billing profile** from the list. Once you take over the ownership of the products, their usage  will be billed to this billing profile.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting billing profiles." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/billing-profile.png" :::  
    *If you don't see Billing profiles, you aren't in the right billing scope.* You need to select a billing account for a Microsoft Customer Agreement and then select Billing profiles. To learn how to change scopes, see [Switch billing scopes in the Azure portal](view-all-accounts.md#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal).
1. Select **Invoice sections** from the left-hand side and then select an invoice section from the list. Each billing profile contains on invoice section by default. Select the invoice where you want to move your Azure product billing - that's where the Azure product consumption is transferred to.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/invoice-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting invoice sections." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/invoice-section.png" :::  
1. Select **Transfer requests** from the lower-left side and then select **Add a new request**. Enter the email address of the user you're requesting billing ownership from. The user must have an account administrator role for the old products.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-request-add-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting transfer requests." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-request-add-email.png" :::
1. Select **Send transfer request**.

## Review and approve transfer request

The recipient of the transfer request uses the following procedure to review and approve the transfer request. They can choose to:

- Transfer one or more subscriptions only
- Transfer one or more reservations only
- Transfer both subscriptions and reservations


1. The user gets an email with instructions to review your transfer request. Select **Review the request** to open it in the Azure portal.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-review-transfer-request-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows review transfer request email." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/mca-review-transfer-request-email.png" :::  
    If the transfer recipient’s user account doesn’t have email enabled, the person that created the request can manually give the target recipient a link to accept the transfer request after the request is created. The person that created the request can navigate to Transfer status page, copy it, and then manually give it to the recipient.  
        :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-status-pending-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Transfer status where you can copy the transfer link sent to the recipient." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-status-pending-link.png" :::
1. In the Azure portal, the user selects the billing account that they want to transfer Azure products from. Then they select eligible subscriptions on the **Subscriptions** tab. If the owner doesn’t want to transfer subscriptions and instead wants to transfer reservations only, make sure that no subscriptions are selected.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-subscriptions-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Subscriptions tab." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-subscriptions-select.png" :::  
    *Disabled subscriptions can't be transferred.*
1. If there are reservations available to transfer, select the **Reservations** tab and then select them. If reservations won’t be transferred, make sure that no reservations are selected.
If reservations are transferred, they're applied to the scope that’s set in the request. If you want to change the scope of the reservation after it’s transferred, see [Change the reservation scope](../reservations/manage-reserved-vm-instance.md#change-the-reservation-scope).
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-reservations-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Reservations tab." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-reservations-select.png" :::
1. Select the **Review request** tab and verify the information about the products to transfer. If there are Warnings or Failed status messages, see the following information. When you're ready to continue, select **Transfer**.   
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Review request tab where you review your transfer selections." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/review-transfer-request-complete.png" :::
1. You'll briefly see a `Transfer is in progress` message. When the transfer is completed successfully, you'll see the Transfer details page with the `Transfer completed successfully` message.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-completed-successfully.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Transfer completed successfully page." lightbox="./media/mca-request-billing-ownership/transfer-completed-successfully.png" :::

On the Review request tab, the following status messages might be displayed.

* **Ready to transfer** - Validation for this Azure product has passed and can be transferred.
* **Warnings** - There's a warning for the selected Azure product. While the product can still be transferred, doing so will have some consequence that the user should be aware of in case they want to take mitigating actions. For example, the Azure subscription being transferred is benefitting from a reservation. After transfer, the subscription will no longer receive that benefit. To maximize savings, ensure that the reservation is associated to another subscription that can use its benefits. Instead, the user can also choose to go back to the selection page and unselect this Azure subscription. Select **Check details** for more information.
* **Failed** - The selected Azure product can't be transferred because of an error. User will need to go back to the selection page and unselect this product to transfer the other selected Azure products.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
