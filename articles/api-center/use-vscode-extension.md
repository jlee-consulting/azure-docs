# Get started with the Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code

To build, discover, try, and consume APIs in your [API center](overview.md), you can use the Azure API Center extension in your Visual Studio Code development environment:

* **Build APIs** - Make APIs you're building discoverable to others by registering them in your API center. Shift-left API design conformance checks into Visual Studio Code with integrated linting support. Ensure that new API versions don't break API consumers with breaking change detection.

* **Discover APIs** - Browse the APIs in your API center, and view their details and documentation.

* **Try APIs** - Use Swagger UI or REST client to explore API requests and responses. 

* **Consume APIs** - Generate API SDK clients for your favorite language including JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, Python, and Java, using the Microsoft Kiota engine that generates SDKs for Microsoft Graph, GitHub, and more.

## Prerequisites

* One or more API centers in your Azure subscription. If you haven't created one already, see [Quickstart: Create your API center](set-up-api-center.md).

    Currently, you need to be assigned the Contributor role or higher permissions to access API centers with the extension.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    
* [Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apidev.azure-api-center)
    
The following Visual Studio Code extensions are optional and needed only for certain scenarios as indicated:

* [REST client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - to send HTTP requests and view the responses in Visual Studio Code directly
* [Microsoft Kiota extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-graph.kiota) - to generate API clients
* [Spectral extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stoplight.spectral) - to run shift-left API design conformance checks in Visual Studio Code
* [Optic CLI](https://github.com/opticdev/optic) - to detect breaking changes between API specification documents
* [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - to generate OpenAPI specification files from API code
    
## Setup

1. Install the Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apidev.azure-api-center). Install optional extensions as needed.
1. In Visual Studio Code, in the Activity Bar on the left, select API Center.
1. If you're not signed in to your Azure account, select **Sign in to Azure...**, and follow the prompts to sign in. 
    Select an Azure account with the API center (or API centers) you wish to view APIs from. You can also filter on specific subscriptions if you have many to view from.

## Register APIs

Register an API in your API center directly from Visual Studio Code, either by registering it as a one-time operation or with a CI/CD pipeline.

1. Use the **Ctrl+Shift+P** keyboard shortcut to open the Command Palette. Type **Azure API Center: Register API** and hit **Enter**.
1. Select how you want to register your API with your API center:
    * **Step-by-step** is best for one-time registration of APIs. 
    * **CI/CD** adds a preconfigured GitHub or Azure DevOps pipeline to your active Visual Studio Code workspace that is run as part of a CI/CD workflow on each commit to source control. It's recommended to inventory APIs with your API center using CI/CD to ensure API metadata including specification and version stay current in your API center as the API continues to evolve over time.
1. Complete registration steps:
    * For **Step-by-step**, select the API center to register APIs with, and answer prompts with information including API title, type, lifecycle stage, version, and specification to complete API registration.
    * For **CI/CD**, select either **GitHub** or **Azure DevOps**, depending on your preferred source control mechanism. A Visual Studio Code workspace must be open for the Azure API Center extension to add a pipeline to your workspace. After the file is added, complete steps documented in the CI/CD pipeline file itself to configure Azure Pipeline/GitHub Action environment variables and identity. On push to source control, the API will be registered in your API center.

## API design conformance

To ensure design conformance with organizational standards as you build APIs, the Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code provides integrated support for API specification linting with Spectral.

1. Use the **Ctrl+Shift+P** keyboard shortcut to open the Command Palette. Type **Azure API Center: Set active API Style Guide** and hit **Enter**.
2. Select one of the default rules provided, or, if your organization has a style guide already available, use **Select Local File** or **Input Remote URL** to specify the active ruleset in Visual Studio Code. Hit **Enter**.

Once an active API style guide is set, opening any OpenAPI or AsyncAPI-based specification file will trigger a local linting operation in Visual Studio Code. Results are displayed both inline in the editor, as well as in the Problems window (**View** > **Problems** or **Ctrl+Shift+M**).

## Breaking change detection

When introducing new versions of your API, it's important to ensure that changes introduced do not break API consumers on previous versions of your API. The Azure API Center extension for Visual Studio Code makes this easy with breaking change detection for OpenAPI specification documents powered by Optic.

1. Use the **Ctrl+Shift+P** keyboard shortcut to open the Command Palette. Type **Azure API Center: Detect Breaking Change** and hit **Enter**.
2. Select the first API specification document to compare. Valid options include API specifications found in your API center, a local file, or the active editor in Visual Studio Code.
3. Select the second API specification document to compare. Valid options include API specifications found in your API center, a local file, or the active editor in Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code will open a diff view between the two API specifications. Any breaking changes are displayed both inline in the editor, as well as in the Problems window (**View** > **Problems** or **Ctrl+Shift+M**).
