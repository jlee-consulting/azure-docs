# Azure Load Balancer health probes

Azure Load Balancer rules require a health probe to detect the endpoint status. The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determines which backend pool instances will receive new connections. Use health probes to detect the failure of an application. Generate a custom response to a health probe. Use the health probe for flow control to manage load or planned downtime. When a health probe fails, the load balancer will stop sending new connections to the respective unhealthy instance. Outbound connectivity isn't affected, only inbound.

Health probes support multiple protocols. The availability of a specific health probe protocol varies by Load Balancer SKU. Additionally, the behavior of the service varies by Load Balancer SKU as shown in this table:

| | Standard SKU | Basic SKU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Probe types](#probe-types)** | TCP, HTTP, HTTPS | TCP, HTTP |
| **[Probe down behavior](#probe-down-behavior)** | All probes down, all TCP flows continue. | All probes down, all TCP flows expire. |

>Load Balancer health probes originate from the IP address 168.63.129.16 and must not be blocked for probes to mark your instance as up. Review [probe source IP address](#probe-source-ip-address) for details. To see this probe traffic within your backend instance, review [the Azure Load Balancer FAQ](./load-balancer-faqs.yml).

>Regardless of configured time-out threshold, HTTP(S) load balancer health probes will automatically mark the instance as down if the server returns any status code that isn't HTTP 200 OK or if the connection is terminated via TCP reset.

## Probe configuration

Health probe configuration consists of the following elements:

* Duration of the interval between individual probes

* Protocol

* Port

* HTTP path to use for HTTP GET when using HTTP(S) probes

>[!NOTE]
>A probe definition is not mandatory or checked for when using Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Templates or API. Probe validation tests are only done when using the Azure Portal.

## Application signal, detection of the signal, and Load Balancer reaction

The interval value determines how frequently the health probe will probe for a response from your backend pool instances. If the health probe fails, it will immediately mark your backend pool instances as unhealthy. On the next healthy probe up, the health probe will immediately mark your backend pool instances as healthy.

For example, a health probe set to five seconds. The time at which a probe is sent isn't synchronized with when your application may change state. The total time it takes for your health probe to reflect your application state can fall into one of the two following scenarios:

1. If your application produces a time-out response just before the next probe arrives, the detection of the events will take 5 seconds plus the duration of the application time-out when the probe arrives. You can assume the detection to take slightly over 5 seconds.

2. If your application produces a time-out response just after the next probe arrives, the detection of the events won't begin until the probe arrives and times out, plus another 5 seconds. You can assume the detection to take just under 10 seconds.

For this example, once detection has occurred, the platform will take a small amount of time to react to the change.  

The reaction depends on:

* When the application changes state
* When the change is detected
* When the next health probe is sent
* When the detection has been communicated across the platform 

Assume the reaction to a time-out response will take a minimum of 5 seconds and a maximum of 10 seconds to react to the change.

This example is provided to illustrate what is taking place. It's not possible to forecast an exact duration beyond the guidance in the example.

>[!NOTE]
>The health probe will probe all running instances in the backend pool. If an instance is stopped it will not be probed until it has been started again.

## Probe types

The protocol used by the health probe can be configured to one of the following options:

* TCP listeners

* HTTP endpoints

* HTTPS endpoints

The available protocols depend on the load balancer SKU used:

|| TCP | HTTP | HTTPS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard SKU** | 	&#9989; | 	&#9989; | 	&#9989; |
| **Basic SKU** | 	&#9989; | 	&#9989; | &#10060; |

### TCP probe

TCP probes initiate a connection by performing a three-way open TCP handshake with the defined port. TCP probes terminate a connection with a four-way close TCP handshake.

The minimum probe interval is 5 seconds and can’t exceed 120 seconds.

A TCP probe fails when:

* The TCP listener on the instance doesn't respond at all during the timeout period.  A probe is marked down based on the number of timed-out probe requests, which were configured to go unanswered before marking down the probe.

* The probe receives a TCP reset from the instance.

### HTTP/HTTPS probe

>[!NOTE]
>HTTPS probe is only available for [Standard Load Balancer](./load-balancer-overview.md).

HTTP and HTTPS probes build on the TCP probe and issue an HTTP GET with the specified path. Both of these probes support relative paths for the HTTP GET. HTTPS probes are the same as HTTP probes with the addition of a Transport Layer Security (TLS). The health probe is marked up when the instance responds with an HTTP status 200 within the timeout period. The health probe attempts to check the configured health probe port every 15 seconds by default. The minimum probe interval is 5 seconds and can’t exceed 120 seconds.

HTTP / HTTPS probes can be useful to implement your own logic to remove instances from load balancer if the probe port is also the listener for the service. For example, you might decide to remove an instance if it's above 90% CPU and return a non-200 HTTP status. 

> [!NOTE] 
> The HTTPS probe requires the use of certificates based that have a minimum signature hash of SHA256 in the entire chain.

If you use Cloud Services and have web roles that use w3wp.exe, you achieve automatic monitoring of your website. Failures in your website code return a non-200 status to the load balancer probe.

An HTTP / HTTPS probe fails when:

* Probe endpoint returns an HTTP response code other than 200 (for example, 403, 404, or 500). The probe is marked down immediately.

* Probe endpoint doesn't respond at all during the minimum of the probe interval and 30-second timeout period. Multiple probe requests might go unanswered before the probe gets marked as not running and until the sum of all timeout intervals has been reached.

* Probe endpoint closes the connection via a TCP reset.

## Probe up behavior

TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS health probes are considered healthy and mark the backend endpoint as healthy when:

* The health probe is successful once after the VM boots.

Any backend endpoint that has achieved a healthy state is eligible for receiving new flows.  

> [!NOTE]
> If the health probe fluctuates, the load balancer waits longer before it puts the backend endpoint back in the healthy state. This extra wait time protects the user and the infrastructure and is an intentional policy.

## Probe down behavior

### TCP connections

New TCP connections will succeed to remaining healthy backend endpoint.

If a backend endpoint's health probe fails, established TCP connections to this backend endpoint continue.

If all probes for all instances in a backend pool fail, no new flows will be sent to the backend pool. Standard Load Balancer will permit established TCP flows to continue.  Basic Load Balancer will terminate all existing TCP flows to the backend pool.
 
Load Balancer is a pass through service. Load Balancer doesn't terminate TCP connections. The flow is always between the client and the VM's guest OS and application. A pool with all probes down results in a frontend that won't respond to TCP connection open attempts. There isn't a healthy backend endpoint to receive the flow and respond with an acknowledgment.

### UDP datagrams

UDP datagrams will be delivered to healthy backend endpoints.

UDP is connection-less and there's no flow state tracked for UDP. If any backend endpoint's health probe fails, existing UDP flows will move to another healthy instance in the backend pool.

If all probes for all instances in a backend pool fail, existing UDP flows will terminate for basic and standard load balancers.

## Probe source IP address

Load Balancer uses a distributed probing service for its internal health model. The probing service resides on each host where VMs and can be programmed on-demand to generate health probes per the customer's configuration. The health probe traffic is directly between the probing service that generates the health probe and the customer VM. All Load Balancer health probes originate from the IP address 168.63.129.16 as their source.

The **AzureLoadBalancer** service tag identifies this source IP address in your [network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) and permits health probe traffic by default.

In addition to load balancer health probes, the [following operations use this IP address](../virtual-network/what-is-ip-address-168-63-129-16.md):

* Enables the VM Agent to communicating with the platform to signal it is in a “Ready” state

* Enables communication with the DNS virtual server to provide filtered name resolution to customers that don't define custom DNS servers.  This filtering ensures that customers can only resolve the hostnames of their deployment.
* Enables the VM to obtain a dynamic IP address from the DHCP service in Azure.

## Design guidance

* Health probes are used to make your service resilient scalable. A misconfiguration can affect the availability and scalability of your service. Review this entire document and consider what the effect to your scenario is when the probe response is up or down. Consider how the probe response affects the availability of your application.

* When you design the health model for your application, probe a port on a backend endpoint that reflects the health of the instance **and** the application service. The application port and the probe port aren't required to be the same. In some scenarios, it may be desirable for the probe port to be different than the port your application uses.

* It can be useful for your application to generate a health probe response, and signal the load balancer whether your instance should receive new connections. You can manipulate the probe response to throttle delivery of new connections to an instance by failing the health probe. You can prepare for maintenance of your application and initiate draining of connections to your application. A [probe down](#probe-down-behavior) signal will always allow TCP flows to continue until idle timeout or connection closure in a Standard Load Balancer. 

* For a UDP load-balanced application, generate a custom health probe signal from the backend endpoint. Use either TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS for the health probe that matches the corresponding listener.

* [HA Ports load-balancing rule](load-balancer-ha-ports-overview.md) with [Standard Load Balancer](./load-balancer-overview.md). All ports are load balanced and a single health probe response must reflect the status of the entire instance.

* Don't translate or proxy a health probe through the instance that receives the health probe to another instance in your virtual network. This configuration can lead to cascading failures in your scenario. For example: A set of third-party appliances is deployed in the backend pool of a load balancer to provide scale and redundancy for the appliances. The health probe is configured to probe a port that the third-party appliance proxies or translates to other virtual machines behind the appliance. If you probe the same port used to translate or proxy requests to the other virtual machines behind the appliance, any probe response from a single virtual machine will mark down the appliance. This configuration can lead to a cascading failure of the application. The trigger can be an intermittent probe failure that will cause the load balancer to mark down the appliance instance. This action can disable your application. Probe the health of the appliance itself. The selection of the probe to determine the health signal is an important consideration for network virtual appliances (NVA) scenarios. Consult your application vendor for the appropriate health signal is for such scenarios.

* If you don't allow the [source IP](#probe-source-ip-address) of the probe in your firewall policies, the health probe will fail as it is unable to reach your instance.  In turn, Load Balancer will mark down your instance due to the health probe failure.  This misconfiguration can cause your load balanced application scenario to fail.

* For Load Balancer's health probe to mark up your instance, you **must** allow this IP address in any Azure [network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) and local firewall policies.  By default, every network security group includes the [service tag](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md#service-tags) AzureLoadBalancer to permit health probe traffic.

* To test a health probe failure or mark down an individual instance, use a [network security group](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md) to explicitly block the health probe. Create an NSG rule to block the destination port or [source IP](#probe-source-ip-address) to simulate the failure of a probe.

* Don't configure your virtual network with the Microsoft owned IP address range that contains 168.63.129.16. The configuration will collide with the IP address of the health probe and can cause your scenario to fail.

* If you have multiple interfaces configured in your virtual machine, ensure you respond to the probe on the interface you received it on. You may need to source network address translate this address in the VM on a per interface basis.

* Don't enable [TCP timestamps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1323). TCP timestamps can cause health probes to fail due to TCP packets being dropped by the VM's guest OS TCP stack. The dropped packets can cause the  load balancer to mark the endpoint as down. TCP timestamps are routinely enabled by default on security hardened VM images and must be disabled.

## Monitoring

Public and internal [Standard Load Balancer](./load-balancer-overview.md) expose per endpoint and backend endpoint health probe status through [Azure Monitor](./monitor-load-balancer.md). These metrics can be consumed by other Azure services or partner applications. 

Azure Monitor logs aren't available for both public and internal Basic Load Balancers.

## Limitations

* HTTPS probes don't support mutual authentication with a client certificate.

* You should assume health probes will fail when TCP timestamps are enabled.

* A Basic SKU load balancer health probe isn't supported with a virtual machine scale set.

* HTTP probes don't support probing on the following ports due to security concerns: 19, 21, 25, 70, 110, 119, 143, 220, 993.
