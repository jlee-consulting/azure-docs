### General Availability - Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2022



**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Other     
**Product capability:** Developer Experience   

In the end of October, the total number of required permissions for any single application registration must not exceed 400 permissions across all APIs.

### General Availability - Deprecation of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server



**Type:** Deprecated   
**Service category:** MFA     
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  

Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services, and to remain in a supported state, organizations should migrate their users’ authentication data to the cloud-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication Server update. For more information, see: [Migrate from MFA Server to Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](../authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa.md).

---

### General Availability - Change of Default User Consent Settings



**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps     
**Product capability:** Developer Experience  

Starting Sept 30th, 2022, Microsoft will require all new tenants to follow a new user consent configuration. While this won't impact any existing tenants that were created before September 30, 2022, all new tenants created after September 30, 2022, will have the default setting of “Enable automatic updates (Recommendation)” under User consent settings. This change reduces the risk of malicious applications attempting to trick users into granting them access to your organization's data. For more information, see: [Configure how users consent to applications](../manage-apps/configure-user-consent.md).

---

### Public Preview - Lifecycle Workflows is now available



**Type:** New feature

With Lifecycle Workflows, you can:

- Confidently configure and deploy custom workflows to onboard and offboard cloud employees at scale replacing your manual processes.
- Automate out-of-the-box actions critical to required Joiner and Leaver scenarios and get rich reporting insights.
- Extend workflows via Logic Apps integrations with custom tasks extensions for more complex scenarios.

For more information, see: [What are Lifecycle Workflows? (Public Preview)](../governance/what-are-lifecycle-workflows.md).

---

### Public Preview - User-to-Group Affiliation recommendation for group Access Reviews



**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Access Reviews     
**Product capability:** Identity Governance

### General Availability - Number Matching for Microsoft Authenticator notifications



**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App      
**Product capability:** User Authentication   

To prevent accidental notification approvals, admins can now require users to enter the number displayed on the sign-in screen when approving an MFA notification in the Microsoft Authenticator app. We've also refreshed the Azure portal admin UX and Microsoft Graph APIs to make it easier for customers to manage Authenticator app feature roll-outs. As part of this update we have also added the highly requested ability for admins to exclude user groups from each feature. 

The number matching feature greatly up-levels the security posture of the Microsoft Authenticator app and protects organizations from MFA fatigue attacks. We highly encourage our customers to adopt this feature leveraging the rollout controls we have built. Number Matching will begin to be enabled for all users of the Microsoft Authenticator app starting 27th of February 2023.


For more information, see: [How to use number matching in multifactor authentication (MFA) notifications - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match.md).

### General Availability - Additional context in Microsoft Authenticator notifications



**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App      
**Product capability:** User Authentication 

Reduce accidental approvals by showing users additional context in Microsoft Authenticator app notifications. Customers can enhance notifications with the following:

- Application Context: This feature will show users which application they're signing into.
- Geographic Location Context: This feature will show users their sign-in location based on the IP address of the device they're signing into. 

The feature is available for both MFA and Password-less Phone Sign-in notifications and greatly increases the security posture of the Microsoft Authenticator app. We've also refreshed the Azure portal Admin UX and Microsoft Graph APIs to make it easier for customers to manage Authenticator app feature roll-outs. As part of this update, we've also added the highly requested ability for admins to exclude user groups from certain features. 

We highly encourage our customers to adopt these critical security features to reduce accidental approvals of Authenticator notifications by end users.


For more information, see: [How to use additional context in Microsoft Authenticator notifications - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/how-to-mfa-additional-context.md).

### General Availability - Workload Identity Federation with App Registrations are available now

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience 

Entra Workload Identity Federation allows developers to exchange tokens issued by another identity provider with Azure AD tokens, without needing secrets.

### Public Preview - Azure AD Domain Services - Trusts for User Forests

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services  
 

You can now create trusts on both user and resource forests. On-premises AD DS users can't authenticate to resources in the Azure AD DS resource forest until you create an outbound trust to your on-premises AD DS. An outbound trust requires network connectivity to your on-premises virtual network on which you have installed Azure AD Domain Service. On a user forest, trusts can be created for on-premises AD forests that aren't synchronized to Azure AD DS.

To learn more about trusts and how to deploy your own, visit [How trust relationships work for forests in Active Directory](../../active-directory-domain-services/concepts-forest-trust.md).

###  General Availability – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true).

 
We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

- You need [Domain Services Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#domain-services-contributor) Azure role to create the required Azure AD DS resources.
