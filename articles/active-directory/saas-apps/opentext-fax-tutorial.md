# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure from the gallery

To configure the integration of OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure into Azure AD, you need to add OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure** in the search box.
1. Select **OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure SSO](#configure-opentext-xm-fax-and-xm-sendsecure-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure test user](#create-opentext-xm-fax-and-xm-sendsecure-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure. Work with [OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure support team](mailto:support@opentext.com) to add the users in the OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to OpenText XM Fax and XM SendSecure Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.
