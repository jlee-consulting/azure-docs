# Single sign-on with MSAL.js

Single sign-on (SSO) provides a more seamless experience by reducing the number of times your users are asked for their credentials. Users enter their credentials once, and the established session can be reused by other applications on the device without further prompting.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enables SSO by setting a session cookie when a user authenticates for the first time. MSAL.js allows the usage of the session cookie for SSO between the browser tabs opened for one or several applications.

## SSO between browser tabs for the same app

When a user has your application open in several tabs and signs in on one of them, they can be signed into the same app open on the other tabs without being prompted. To do so, you'll need to set the *cacheLocation* in MSAL.js configuration object to `localStorage` as shown below.

```javascript
const config = {
  auth: {
    clientId: "1111-2222-3333-4444-55555555",
  },
  cache: {
    cacheLocation: "localStorage",
  },
};

const msalInstance = new msal.PublicClientApplication(config);
```

## SSO between different apps

When a user authenticates, a session cookie is set on the Azure AD domain in the browser. MSAL.js relies on this session cookie to provide SSO for the user between different applications. MSAL.js also caches the ID tokens and access tokens of the user in the browser storage per application domain.

MSAL.js offers the `ssoSilent` method to sign-in the user and obtain tokens without an interaction. However, if the user has multiple user accounts in a session with Azure AD, then the user is prompted to pick an account to sign in with. As such, there are two ways to achieve SSO using `ssoSilent` method.

### With user hint

To improve performance and ensure that the authorization server will look for the correct account session. You can pass one of the following options in the request object of the `ssoSilent` method to obtain the token silently.

- Session ID `sid` (which can be retrieved from `idTokenClaims` of an `account` object)
- `login_hint` (which can be retrieved from the `account` object username property or the `upn` claim in the ID token)
- `account` (which can be retrieved from using one the [account methods](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/login-user.md#account-apis))

#### Using a session ID

To use a session ID, add `sid` as an [optional claim](active-directory-optional-claims.md) to your app's ID tokens. The `sid` claim allows an application to identify a user's Azure AD session independent of their account name or username. To learn how to add optional claims like `sid`, see [Provide optional claims to your app](active-directory-optional-claims.md). Use the session ID (SID) in silent authentication requests you make with `ssoSilent` in MSAL.js.

```javascript
const request = {
  scopes: ["user.read"],
  sid: sid,
};

 try {
    const loginResponse = await msalInstance.ssoSilent(request);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
        const loginResponse = await msalInstance.loginPopup(request).catch(error => {
            // handle error
        });
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

#### Using a login hint

To bypass the account selection prompt typically shown during interactive authentication requests (or for silent requests when you haven't configured the `sid` optional claim), provide a `loginHint`. In multi-tenant applications, also include a `domain_hint`.

```javascript
const request = {
  scopes: ["user.read"],
  loginHint: preferred_username,
  extraQueryParameters: { domain_hint: "organizations" },
};

try {
    const loginResponse = await msalInstance.ssoSilent(request);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
        const loginResponse = await msalInstance.loginPopup(request).catch(error => {
            // handle error
        });
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

Get the values for `loginHint` and `domain_hint` from the user's **ID token**:

- `loginHint`: Use the ID token's `preferred_username` claim value.

- `domain_hint`: Use the ID token's `tid` claim value. Required in requests made by multi-tenant applications that use the */common* authority. Optional for other applications.

For more information about login hint and domain hint, see [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md).

#### Using an account object

If you know the user account information, you can also retrieve the user account by using the `getAccountByUsername()` or `getAccountByHomeId()` methods:

```javascript
const username = "test@contoso.com";
const myAccount  = msalInstance.getAccountByUsername(username);

const request = {
    scopes: ["User.Read"],
    account: myAccount
};

try {
    const loginResponse = await msalInstance.ssoSilent(request);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
        const loginResponse = await msalInstance.loginPopup(request).catch(error => {
            // handle error
        });
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

### Without user hint

You can attempt to use the `ssoSilent` method without passing any `account`, `sid` or `login_hint` as shown in the code below:

```javascript
const request = {
    scopes: ["User.Read"]
};

try {
    const loginResponse = await msalInstance.ssoSilent(request);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
        const loginResponse = await msalInstance.loginPopup(request).catch(error => {
            // handle error
        });
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

However, there's a likelihood of silent sign-in errors if the application has multiple users in a single browser session or if the user has multiple accounts for that single browser session. You may see the following error in the case of multiple accounts:

```txt
InteractionRequiredAuthError: interaction_required: AADSTS16000: Either multiple user identities are available for the current request or selected account is not supported for the scenario.
```

The error indicates that the server couldn't determine which account to sign into, and will require either one of the parameters above (`account`, `login_hint`, `sid`) or an interactive sign-in to choose the account.

## Considerations when using `ssoSilent`

### Redirect URI (reply URL)

For better performance and to help avoid issues, set the `redirectUri` to a blank page or other page that doesn't use MSAL.

- If your application users only popup and silent methods, set the `redirectUri` on the `PublicClientApplication` configuration object.
- If your application also uses redirect methods, set the `redirectUri` on a per-request basis.

### Third-party cookies

`ssoSilent` attempts to open a hidden iframe and reuse an existing session with Azure AD. This won't work in browsers that block third-party cookies such as safari, and will lead to an interaction error:

```txt
InteractionRequiredAuthError: login_required: AADSTS50058: A silent sign-in request was sent but no user is signed in. The cookies used to represent the user's session were not sent in the request to Azure AD
```

To resolve the error, the user must create an interactive authentication request using the `loginPopup()` or `loginRedirect()`.

Additionally, the request object is required when using the **silent** methods. If you already have the user's sign-in information, you can pass either the `loginHint` or `sid` optional parameters to sign-in a specific account.

## SSO in ADAL.js to MSAL.js update

MSAL.js brings feature parity with ADAL.js for Azure AD authentication scenarios. To make the migration from ADAL.js to MSAL.js easy and to avoid prompting your users to sign in again, the library reads the ID token representing userâ€™s session in ADAL.js cache, and seamlessly signs in the user in MSAL.js.

To take advantage of the SSO behavior when updating from ADAL.js, you'll need to ensure the libraries are using `localStorage` for caching tokens. Set the `cacheLocation` to `localStorage` in both the MSAL.js and ADAL.js configuration at initialization as follows:

```javascript

// In ADAL.js
window.config = {
  clientId: "1111-2222-3333-4444-55555555",
  cacheLocation: "localStorage",
};

var authContext = new AuthenticationContext(config);

// In latest MSAL.js version
const config = {
  auth: {
    clientId: "1111-2222-3333-4444-55555555",
  },
  cache: {
    cacheLocation: "localStorage",
  },
};

const msalInstance = new msal.PublicClientApplication(config);
```

Once the `cacheLocation` is configured, MSAL.js can read the cached state of the authenticated user in ADAL.js and use that to provide SSO in MSAL.js.
