# Logging in MSAL.NET

[!INCLUDE [MSAL logging introduction](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-error-logging-introduction.md)]

## Configure logging in MSAL.NET

In MSAL logging is set at application creation using the `.WithLogging` builder modifier. This method takes optional parameters:

- `Level` enables you to decide which level of logging you want. Setting it to Errors will only get errors
- `PiiLoggingEnabled` enables you to log personal and organizational data (PII) if set to true. By default this is set to false, so that your application does not log personal data.
- `LogCallback` is set to a delegate that does the logging. If `PiiLoggingEnabled` is true, this method will receive messages that can have PII, in which case the `containsPii` flag will be set to true.
- `DefaultLoggingEnabled` enables the default logging for the platform. By default it's false. If you set it to true it uses Event Tracing in Desktop/UWP applications, NSLog on iOS and logcat on Android.

```csharp
class Program
{
  private static void Log(LogLevel level, string message, bool containsPii)
  {
     if (containsPii)
     {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
     }
     Console.WriteLine($"{level} {message}");
     Console.ResetColor();
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var scopes = new string[] { "User.Read" };

    var application = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create("<clientID>")
                      .WithLogging(Log, LogLevel.Info, true)
                      .Build();

    AuthenticationResult result = application.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
                                             .ExecuteAsync().Result;
  }
}
```
