# Limitations with Azure AD certificate-based authentication 

This topic covers supported and unsupported scenarios for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) certificate-based authentication.

>[!NOTE]
>Azure AD certificate-based authentication is currently in public preview. Some features might not be supported or have limited capabilities. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications on all platforms.
- User sign-ins on mobile native browsers.
- Support for granular authentication rules for multifactor authentication by using the certificate issuer **Subject** and **policy OIDs**.
- Configuring certificate-to-user account bindings by using the certificate Subject Alternate Name (SAN) principal name and SAN RFC822 name.

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios aren't supported:

- Public Key Infrastructure for creating client certificates. Customers need to configure their own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and provision certificates to their users and devices. 
- Certificate Authority hints aren't supported, so the list of certificates that appears for users in the UI isn't scoped.
- Only one CRL Distribution Point (CDP) for a trusted CA is supported.
- The CDP can be only HTTP URLs. We don't support Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) URLs.
- Configuring other certificate-to-user account bindings, such as using the **subject field**, or **keyid** and **issuer**, arenâ€™t available in this release.
- Currently, password can't be disabled when CBA is enabled and the option to sign in using a password is displayed.
