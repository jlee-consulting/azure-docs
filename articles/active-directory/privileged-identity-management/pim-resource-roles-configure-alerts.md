# Configure security alerts for Azure roles in Privileged Identity Management

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) generates alerts when there is suspicious or unsafe activity in your organization in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra. When an alert is triggered, it shows up on the Alerts page.

## Review alerts

Select an alert to see a report that lists the users or roles that triggered the alert, along with remediation guidance.

## Alerts

Alert | Severity | Trigger | Recommendation
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Too many owners assigned to a resource** | Medium | Too many users have the owner role. | Review the users in the list and reassign some to less privileged roles.
**Too many permanent owners assigned to a resource** | Medium | Too many users are permanently assigned to a role. | Review the users in the list and re-assign some to require activation for role use.
**Duplicate role created** | Medium | Multiple roles have the same criteria. | Use only one of these roles.
**Roles are being assigned outside of Privileged Identity Management (Preview)** | High | A role is managed directly through the Azure IAM resource blade or the Azure Resource Manager API | Review the users in the list and remove them from privileged roles assigned outside of Privilege Identity Management. 

> [!NOTE]
> During the public preview of the **Roles are being assigned outside of Privileged Identity Management (Preview)** alert, Microsoft supports only permissions that are assigned at the subscription level. 

### Severity

- **High**: Requires immediate action because of a policy violation. 
- **Medium**: Does not require immediate action but signals a potential policy violation.
- **Low**: Does not require immediate action but suggests a preferred policy change.

## Configure security alert settings

From the Alerts page, go to **Settings**.
