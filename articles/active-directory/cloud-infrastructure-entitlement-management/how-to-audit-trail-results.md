# Generate an on-demand report from a query

This article describes how you can generate an on-demand report from a query in the **Audit** dashboard in Permissions Management. You can:

- Run a report on-demand.
- Schedule and run a report as often as you want.
- Share a report with other members of your team and management.

## Generate a custom report on-demand

1. In the Permissions Management home page, select the **Audit** tab.

    Permissions Management displays the query options available to you.
1. In the **Audit** dashboard, select **Search** to run the query.
1. Select **Export**.

    Permissions Management generates the report and exports it in comma-separated values (**CSV**) format, portable document format (**PDF**), or Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (**XLSX**) format.

## Create a schedule to automatically generate and share a report

1. In the **Audit** tab, load the query you want to use to generate your report.
2. Select **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. In **Repeat on**, select on which days of the week you want the report to run.
4. In **Date**, select the date when you want the query to run.
5. In **hh mm** (time), select the time when you want the query to run.
6. In **Request file format**, select the file format you want for your report.
7. In **Share report with people**, enter email addresses for people to whom you want to send the report.
8. Select **Schedule**.

    Permissions Management generates the report as set in Steps 3 to 6, and emails it to the recipients you specified in Step 7.


## Delete the schedule for a report

1. In the **Audit** tab, load the query whose report schedule you want to delete.
2. Select the ellipses menu **(â€¦)** on the far right, and then select **Delete schedule**.

    Permissions Management deletes the schedule for running the query. The query itself isn't deleted.
