# Secure hybrid access: Secure legacy apps with Azure Active Directory

You can now protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Azure Active Directory (AD) with:

- [Azure AD Application Proxy](#secure-hybrid-access-through-azure-ad-application-proxy)

- [Secure hybrid access partners](#secure-hybrid-access-through-azure-ad-partner-integrations)

You can bridge the gap and strengthen your security posture across all applications with Azure AD capabilities like [Azure AD Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) and [Azure AD Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection). By having Azure AD as an Identity provider (IDP), you can use modern authentication and authorization methods like [single sign-on (SSO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on) and [multifactor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) to secure your on-premises legacy applications.

## Secure hybrid access through Azure AD Application Proxy
  
Using [Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy) you can provide [secure remote access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application) to your on-premises web applications. Your users donâ€™t need to use a VPN. Users benefit by easily connecting to their applications from any device after a [SSO](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-config-sso-how-to#how-to-configure-single-sign-on). Application Proxy provides remote access as a service and allows you to [easily publish your on-premise applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application) to users outside the corporate network. It helps you scale your cloud access management without requiring you to modify your on-premises applications. [Plan an Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-deployment-plan) deployment as a next step.

## Secure hybrid access through Azure AD partner integrations  

In addition to [Azure AD Application Proxy](https://aka.ms/whyappproxy), Microsoft partners with third-party providers to enable secure access to your on-premises applications and applications that use legacy authentication.
