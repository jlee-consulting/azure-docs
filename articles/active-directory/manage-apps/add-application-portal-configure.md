# Configure enterprise application properties

This article shows you where you can configure the properties of an enterprise application in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information about the properties that you can configure, see [Properties of an enterprise application](application-properties.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure the properties of an enterprise application, you need:

- An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.

## Configure application properties

Application properties control how the application is represented and how the application is accessed.

To configure the application properties:

1. Go to the [Azure Active Directory Admin Center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) and sign in using one of the roles listed in the prerequisites.
1. In the left menu, select **Enterprise applications**. The **All applications** pane opens and displays a list of the applications in your Azure AD tenant. Search for and select the application that you want to use.
1. In the **Manage** section, select **Properties** to open the **Properties** pane for editing.
1. Configure the properties based on the needs of your application.
