# Link your domain to your Decentralized Identifier (DID)

[!INCLUDE [Verifiable Credentials announcement](../../../includes/verifiable-credentials-brand.md)]


## Prerequisites

To link your DID to your domain, you need to have completed the following.

- Complete the [Getting Started](get-started-verifiable-credentials.md) and subsequent [tutorial set](enable-your-tenant-verifiable-credentials.md).

## Why do we need to link our DID to our domain?

A DID starts out as an identifier that isn't anchored to existing systems. A DID is useful because a user or organization can own it and control it. If an entity interacting with the organization doesn't know 'who' the DID belongs to, then the DID isn't as useful.

Linking a DID to a domain solves the initial trust problem by allowing any entity to cryptographically verify the relationship between a DID and a Domain.

## When do you need to update the domain in your DID?

In the event where the domain associated with your company changes, you would also need to change the domain in your DID document. You can update the domain in your DID directly from the [Microsoft Entra Verified ID blade in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_DecentralizedIdentity/InitialMenuBlade/~/domainUpdateBlade).

## How do we link DIDs and domains?

We follow the [Well-Known DID configuration](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/) specification when creating the link. The verifiable credentials service links your DID and domain. The service includes the domain information that you provided in your DID, and generates the well-known config file:

1. Azure AD uses the domain information you provide during organization setup to write a Service Endpoint within the DID Document. All parties who interact with your DID can see the domain your DID proclaims to be associated with.  
  
    ```json
    "service": [
      {
        "id": "#linkeddomains",
        "type": "LinkedDomains",
        "serviceEndpoint": {
          "origins": [
            "https://www.contoso.com/"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

2. The verifiable credential service in Azure AD generates a compliant well-known configuration resource that you can host on your domain. The configuration file includes a self-issued verifiable credential of credentialType 'DomainLinkageCredential' signed with your DID that has an origin of your domain. Here's an example of the config doc that is stored at the root domain URL.


    ```json
    {
      "@context": "https://identity.foundation/.well-known/contexts/did-configuration-v0.0.jsonld",
      "linked_dids": [
        "jwt..."
      ]
    }
    ```

After you have the well-known configuration file, you need to make the file available using the domain name you specified when you enabled your Azure AD for verifiable credentials.

- Host the well-known DID configuration file at the root of the domain.
- Don't use redirects.
- Use https to distribute the configuration file.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Microsoft Authenticator does not honor redirects, the URL specified must be the final destination URL.

## User experience in the wallet

When a user is going through an issuance flow or presenting a verifiable credential, they should know something about the organization and its DID. Microsoft Authenticator, validates a DID's relationship with the domain in the DID document and presents users with two different experiences depending on the outcome.

## Verified domain

Before Microsoft Authenticator displays a **Verified** icon, a few things need to be true:

* The DID signing the self-issued open ID (SIOP) request must have a Service endpoint for Linked Domain.
* The root domain doesn't use a redirect and uses https.
* The domain listed in the DID Document has a resolvable well-known resource.
* The well-known resource's verifiable credential is signed with the same DID that was used to sign the SIOP that Microsoft Authenticator used to kick start the flow.

If all of the previously mentioned are true, then Microsoft Authenticator displays a verified page and includes the domain that was validated.

## Unverified domain

If any of the above aren't true, Microsoft Authenticator displays a full page warning to the user indicating that the domain is unverified. The user is warned that they are in the middle of a potential risky transaction and they should proceed with caution. We have chosen to take this route because:

* The DID is either not anchored to a domain.
* The configuration wasn't set up properly.
* The DID that the user is interacting with could be malicious and actually can't prove that they own the domain linked. 

It is of high importance that you link your DID to a domain recognizable to the user.

## How do you update the linked domain on your DID?

1. Navigate to the Verified ID in the Azure portal.  
1. On the left side of the page, select **Registration**.
1. In the Domain box, enter your new domain name.
1. Select **Publish**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-dnsbind/publish-update-domain.png" alt-text="Choose the publish button so your changes become":::

If the trust system is ION, it might take up to two hours for your DID document to be updated in the [ION network](https://identity.foundation/ion) with the new domain information. No other changes to the domain are possible before the changes are published. If the trust system is Web, the changes are public as soon as you replace the did-configuration.json file on your web server.

>[!NOTE]
>If your changes are successful you will need to [verify](#verified-domain) your newly added domain.


:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-dnsbind/verification.png" alt-text="You need to verify your domain once that the publishing process completes":::

### Do I need to wait for my DID Doc to be updated to verify my newly added domains?

Yes. You need to wait until the config.json file gets updated before you publish it using your domain's hosting location.  

### How do I know when the linked domain update has successfully completed?

If the trust system is ION, once the domain changes are published to ION, the domain section inside the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service will display Published as the status and you should be able to make new changes to the domain. If the trust system is Web, the changes are public as soon as you replace the did-configuration.json file on your web server.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> No changes to your domain are possible while publishing is in progress.

## Distribute well-known config

1. From the Azure portal, navigate to the Verified ID page. Select **Registration** and choose **Verify** for the domain

2. Download the did-configuration.json file shown in the image below.

   ![Download well known config](media/how-to-dnsbind/verify-download.png) 

3. Copy the linked_did value (JWT), open [https://jwt.ms/](https://www.jwt.ms), paste the JWT, and validate the domain is correct.

4. Copy your DID and open the [ION Network Explorer](https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer) to verify the same domain is included in the DID Document. 

5. Host the well-known config resource at the location specified. Example: `https://www.example.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json`

6. Test out issuing or presenting with Microsoft Authenticator to validate. Make sure the setting in Authenticator 'Warn about unsafe apps' is toggled on.

>[!NOTE]
>By default, 'Warn about unsafe apps' is turned on.

Congratulations, you now have bootstrapped the web of trust with your DID!

## How can I verify that the verification is working?

The portal verifies that the `did-configuration.json` is reachable and correct when you click the **Refresh verification status** button. You should also consider verifying that you can request that URL in a browser to avoid errors like not using https, a bad SSL certificate or the URL not being public. If the `did-configuration.json` file cannot be requested anonymously in a browser or via tools such as `curl`, without warnings or errors, the portal will not be able to complete the **Refresh verification status** step either.

>[!NOTE]
> If you are experiencing problems refreshing your verification status, you can troubleshoot it via running `curl -Iv https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json` on an machine with Ubuntu OS. Windows Subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu will work too. If curl fails, refreshing the verification status will not work.

## Linked Domain domain made easy for developers

The easiest way for a developer to get a domain to use for linked domain is to use Azure Storage's static website feature. You can't control what the domain name will be, other than it will contain your storage account name as part of it's hostname.

Follow these steps to quickly set up a domain to use for Linked Domain:

1. Create an **Azure Storage account**. During storage account creation, choose StorageV2 (general-purpose v2 account) and Locally redundant storage (LRS).
1. Go to that Storage Account and select **Static website** in the left hand menu and enable static website. If you can't see the **Static website** menu item, you didn't create a **V2** storage account.
1. Copy the primary endpoint name that appears after saving. This value is your domain name. It looks something like `https://<your-storageaccountname>.z6.web.core.windows.net/`.

When it comes time to upload the `did-configuration.json` file, take the following steps:

1. Go to that Storage Account and select **Containers** in the left hand menu. Then select the container named `$web`.
1. Select **Upload** and select on the folder icon to find your file
1. Before uploaded, open the **Advanced** section and specify `.well-known` in the **Upload to folder** textbox.
1. Upload the file.

You now have your file publicly available at a URL that looks something like `https://<your-storageaccountname>.z6.web.core.windows.net/.well-known/did-configuration.json`.
