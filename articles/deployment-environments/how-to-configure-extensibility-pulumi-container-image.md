# Configure ADE to execute deployments with Pulumi

In this article, you learn how to utilize [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) for deployments in Azure Deployment Environments (ADE). You learn how to use a standard image provided by Pulumi or how to configure a custom image to provision infrastructure using the Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) framework.

ADE supports an extensibility model that enables you to create custom images that you can use in your environment definitions. To use this extensibility model, you can create your own custom images, and store them in a public container registry. You can then reference these images in your environment definitions to deploy your environments.

An environment definition comprises at least two files: a Pulumi project file, *Pulumi.yaml*, and a manifest file named *environment.yaml*. It may also contain a user program written in your preferred programming language: C#, TypeScript, Python, etc. ADE uses containers to deploy environment definitions.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure Deployment Environments set up in your Azure subscription. 
  - To set up ADE, follow the [Quickstart: Configure Azure Deployment Environments](quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md).

## Use a standard Docker image provided by Pulumi

The Pulumi team provides a prebuilt image to get you started, which you can see in the [Runner-Image](https://github.com/pulumi/azure-deployment-environments/tree/main/Runner-Image) folder. This image is publicly available at Pulumi's Docker Hub as [`pulumi/azure-deployment-environments`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pulumi/azure-deployment-environments), so you can use it directly from your ADE environment definitions.

Here's a sample ```environment.yaml``` file that utilizes the prebuilt image:

```yaml
name: SampleDefinition
version: 1.0.0
summary: First Pulumi-Enabled Environment
description: Deploys a Storage Account with Pulumi
runner: pulumi/azure-deployment-environments:0.1.0
templatePath: Pulumi.yaml
```

You can find a few sample environment definitions in the [Environments folder](https://github.com/pulumi/azure-deployment-environments/tree/main/Environments).

## Build and utilize a custom Docker image

You can build custom images based on the ADE sample images by using the ADE CLI tool. Use the ADE CLI to customize your deployments and deletions to fit your workflow. The ADE CLI is preinstalled on the sample images. To learn more about the ADE CLI, see the [CLI Custom Runner Image reference](https://aka.ms/deployment-environments/ade-cli-reference).

In this example, you learn how to build a Docker image to utilize ADE deployments and access the ADE CLI, basing your image on one of the ADE authored images.

### Select a sample container image by using the FROM statement

Include a FROM statement within a created DockerFile for your new image pointing to a sample image hosted on Microsoft Artifact Registry.

Here's an example FROM statement, referencing the sample core image:

```docker
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/deployment-environments/runners/core:latest
```

This statement pulls the most recently published core image, and makes it a basis for your custom image.

The ADE sample images are based on the Azure CLI image, and have the ADE CLI and JQ packages preinstalled. You can learn more about the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/), and the [JQ package](https://devdocs.io/jq/).

To install any more packages you need within your image, use the RUN statement.

### Install Pulumi in a Dockerfile

You can install the Pulumi CLI to an executable location so that it can be used in your deployment and deletion scripts. 

Here's an example of that process, installing the latest version of the Pulumi CLI:

```docker
RUN apk add curl
RUN curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
ENV PATH="${PATH}:/root/.pulumi/bin"
```

Depending on which programming language you intend to use for Pulumi programs, you might need to install one or more corresponding runtime. The Python runtime is already available in the base image.

Here's an example of installing Node.js and TypeScript:

```docker
# install node.js, npm, and typescript
RUN apk add nodejs npm
RUN npm install typescript -g
```

### Execute operation shell scripts

Within the sample images, operations are determined and executed based on the operation name. Currently, the two operation names supported are *deploy* and *delete*.

To set up your custom image to utilize this structure, specify a folder at the level of your Dockerfile named *scripts*, and specify two files, *deploy.sh*, and *delete.sh*. The deploy shell script runs when your environment is created or redeployed, and the delete shell script runs when your environment is deleted. You can see examples of shell scripts in the repository under the [Runner-Image/scripts folder](https://github.com/pulumi/azure-deployment-environments/tree/main/Runner-Image/scripts).

To ensure these shell scripts are executable, add the following lines to your Dockerfile:

```docker
COPY scripts/* /scripts/
RUN find /scripts/ -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec dos2unix '{}' '+'
RUN find /scripts/ -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```

### Author operation shell scripts to use the Pulumi CLI

There are four steps to deploy infrastructure via Pulumi: 

1. `pulumi login` - connect to the state storage, either in local file system or in [Pulumi Cloud](https://www.pulumi.com/product/pulumi-cloud/)
1. `pulumi stack select` - create or select the stack to use for the particular environment
1. `pulumi config set` - pass deployment parameters as Pulumi configuration values
1. `pulumi up` - run the deployment to create new or update existing infrastructure in Azure

During the core image's entrypoint, any existing local state files are pulled into the container and the directory saved under the environment variable ```$ADE_STORAGE```. In order to access the existing state file, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p $ADE_STORAGE
export PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=
pulumi login file://$ADE_STORAGE
```

To log in to Pulumi Cloud instead, set your Pulumi access token as an environment variable, and run the following commands:

```bash
export PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN
pulumi login
```

Any parameters set for the current environment are stored under the variable ```$ADE_OPERATION_PARAMETERS```. Additionally, the selected Azure region and resource group name are passed in ```ADE_ENVIRONMENT_LOCATION``` and ```ADE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME``` respectively. In order to set your Pulumi stack config, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create or select the stack for the current environment
pulumi stack select $ADE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME --create

# Store configuration values in durable storage
export PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE=$ADE_STORAGE/Pulumi.$ADE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME.yaml

# Set the Pulumi stack config
pulumi config set azure-native:location $ADE_ENVIRONMENT_LOCATION --config-file $PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE
pulumi config set resource-group-name $ADE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --config-file $PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE
echo "$ADE_OPERATION_PARAMETERS" | jq -r 'to_entries|.[]|[.key, .value] | @tsv' |
  while IFS=$'\t' read -r key value; do
    pulumi config set $key $value --config-file $PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE
  done
```


Additionally, to utilize ADE privileges to deploy infrastructure inside your subscription, your script needs to use ADE Managed Service Identity (MSI) when provisioning infrastructure by using the Pulumi Azure Native or Azure Classic provider. If your deployment needs special permissions to complete your deployment, such as particular roles, assign those permissions to the project environment type's identity that is being used for your environment deployment. ADE sets the relevant environment variables, such as the client, tenant, and subscription IDs within the core image's entrypoint, so run the following commands to ensure the provider uses ADE MSI:

```bash
export ARM_USE_MSI=true
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=$ADE_CLIENT_ID
export ARM_TENANT_ID=$ADE_TENANT_ID
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$ADE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Now, you can run the `pulumi up` command to execute the deployment:
```bash
pulumi up --refresh --yes --config-file $PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE
```

During your deletion script, you can instead run the `destroy` command, as shown in the following example:
```bash
pulumi destroy --refresh --yes --config-file $PULUMI_CONFIG_FILE
```

Finally, to make the outputs of your deployment uploaded and accessible when accessing your environment via the Azure CLI, transform the output object from Pulumi to the ADE-specified format through the JQ package. Set the value to the $ADE_OUTPUTS environment variable, as shown in the following example:
```bash
stackout=$(pulumi stack output --json | jq -r 'to_entries|.[]|{(.key): {type: "string", value: (.value)}}')
echo "{\"outputs\": ${stackout:-{\}}}" > $ADE_OUTPUTS
```

### Build the image

Before you build the image to be pushed to your registry, ensure the [Docker Engine is installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on your computer. Then, navigate to the directory of your Dockerfile, and run the following command:

```docker
docker build . -t {YOUR_REGISTRY}.azurecr.io/{YOUR_REPOSITORY}:{YOUR_TAG}
```

For example, if you want to save your image under a repository within your registry named `customImage`, and upload with the tag version of `1.0.0`, you would run:

```docker
docker build . -t {YOUR_REGISTRY}.azurecr.io/customImage:1.0.0
```

### Push the Docker image to a registry

In order to use custom images, you need to set up a publicly accessible image registry with anonymous image pull enabled. This way, Azure Deployment Environments can access your custom image to execute in our container.

#### Create an Azure Container Registry and publish your image with Pulumi

Azure Container Registry is an Azure offering that stores container images and similar artifacts.

You can use Pulumi to create an Azure Container Registry and publish your image to it. Refer to the [Provisioning/custom-image](https://github.com/pulumi/azure-deployment-environments/tree/main/Provisioning/custom-image) example for a self-contained Pulumi project that creates all the required resources in your Azure account.

#### Create an Azure Container Registry and publish your image manually via CLI

To create a registry, which can be done through the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, PowerShell commands, and more, follow one of the [quickstarts](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli).

To set up your registry to have anonymous image pull enabled, run the following commands in the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az login
az acr login -n {YOUR_REGISTRY}
az acr update -n {YOUR_REGISTRY} --public-network-enabled true
az acr update -n {YOUR_REGISTRY} --anonymous-pull-enabled true
```

When you're ready to push your image to your registry, run the following command:

```docker
docker push {YOUR_REGISTRY}.azurecr.io/{YOUR_IMAGE_LOCATION}:{YOUR_TAG}
```

### Connect the image to your environment definition

When authoring environment definitions to use your custom image in their deployment, edit the `runner` property on the manifest file (environment.yaml or manifest.yaml).

```yaml
runner: "{YOUR_REGISTRY}.azurecr.io/{YOUR_REPOSITORY}:{YOUR_TAG}"
```

## Access operation logs and error details

ADE stores error details for a failed deployment the *$ADE_ERROR_LOG* file. 

To troubleshoot a failed deployment:

1. Sign in to the [Developer Portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com/).
1. Identify the environment that failed to deploy, and select **See details**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-extensibility-pulumi-container-image/failed-deployment-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing failed deployment error details, specifically an invalid name for a storage account." lightbox="media/how-to-configure-extensibility-pulumi-container-image/failed-deployment-card.png":::

1. Review the error details in the **Error Details** section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-extensibility-pulumi-container-image/deployment-error-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a failed deployment of an environment with the See Details button displayed." lightbox="media/how-to-configure-extensibility-pulumi-container-image/deployment-error-details.png":::

Additionally, you can use the Azure CLI to view an environment's error details using the following command:
```bash
az devcenter dev environment show --environment-name {YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME} --project {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}
```

To view the operation logs for an environment deployment or deletion, use the Azure CLI to retrieve the latest operation for your environment, and then view the logs for that operation ID.

```bash
# Get list of operations on the environment, choose the latest operation
az devcenter dev environment list-operation --environment-name {YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME} --project {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}
# Using the latest operation ID, view the operation logs
az devcenter dev environment show-logs-by-operation --environment-name {YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME} --project {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME} --operation-id {LATEST_OPERATION_ID}
```
