# Connect to SFTP from workflows in Azure Logic Apps (Deprecated)

The SFTP connector is deprecated, so this connector's operations no longer appear in the workflow designer. However, you can use the [SFTP-SSH connector](/connectors/sftpwithssh/) instead. For more information, see [Connect to an SFTP file server using SSH in Azure Logic Apps](connectors-sftp-ssh.md).

Next steps:
