# Protected material detection

The [Protected material text API](../quickstart-protected-material.md) flags known text content (for example, song lyrics, articles, recipes, and selected web content) that might be output by large language models. This guide provides details about the kind of content that the protected material API detects.

## Protected material examples

Refer to this table for details of the major categories of protected material text detection. All four categories are applied when you call the API.
