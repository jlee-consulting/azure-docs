If you're planning to use Spatial Analysis in Azure AI Vision or Text Analytics for Health in Azure AI Language, then you must create your first Vision or Language resources from the Azure portal so you can review and acknowledge the terms and conditions. You can do so here: [Azure AI Language](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics), [Azure AI Vision](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision). After that, you can create subsequent resources using any deployment tool (for example, SDK, CLI, or ARM template) under the same Azure subscription.
