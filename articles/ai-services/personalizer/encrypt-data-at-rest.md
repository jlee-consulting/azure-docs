# Encryption of data at rest in Personalizer

[!INCLUDE [Deprecation announcement](includes/deprecation.md)]

Personalizer is a service in Azure AI services that uses a machine learning model to provide apps with user-tailored content. When Personalizer persists data to the cloud, it encrypts that data. This encryption protects your data and helps you meet organizational security and compliance commitments.
