# Compare Custom Vision to alternative Azure services

The [Azure AI Vision Image Analysis API](../../computer-vision/overview-image-analysis.md), based on Florence foundational model, now supports custom models with few-shot learning capability. Image Analysis is a separate offering from Azure Custom Vision. Use this guide to compare the two services.

To migrate an existing Custom Vision project to the Image Analysis 4.0 system, see the [Migration guide](../../computer-vision/how-to/migrate-from-custom-vision.md).

## Custom model training

Instead of Custom Vision, you can use the [Image Analysis 4.0 model customization](../../computer-vision/how-to/model-customization.md) feature to create custom image identifier models with the latest technology from Azure.

## Product recognition

Instead of using the Custom Vision product-on-shelves model, you can use [Image Analysis 4.0 Product Recogntion](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/concept-shelf-analysis) feature to train custom models that recognize retail products on shelves.
