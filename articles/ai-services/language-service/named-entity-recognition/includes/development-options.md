To use named entity recognition, you submit raw unstructured text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no additional customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use named entity recognition:


|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Language studio     | Language Studio is a web-based platform that lets you try entity linking with text examples without an Azure account, and your own data when you sign up. For more information, see the [Language Studio website](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/tryout/namedEntities) or [language studio quickstart](../../language-studio.md).         |
|REST API or Client library (Azure SDK)      | Integrate named entity recognition into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in a variety of languages. For more information, see the [named entity recognition quickstart](../quickstart.md).        |
