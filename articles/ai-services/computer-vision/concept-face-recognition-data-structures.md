# Face recognition data structures

This article explains the data structures used in the Face service for face recognition operations. These data structures hold data on faces and persons.

[!INCLUDE [Gate notice](./includes/identity-gate-notice.md)]

## Data structures used with Identify 

The Face Identify API uses container data structures to the hold face recognition data in the form of **Person** objects. There are three types of containers for this, listed from oldest to newest. We recommend you always use the newest one. 

### PersonGroup 

**PersonGroup** is the smallest container data structure.
- You need to specify a recognition model when you create a **PersonGroup**. When any faces are added to that **PersonGroup**, it uses that model to process them. This model must match the model version with Face ID from detect API.
- You must call the Train API to make any new face data reflect in the Identify API results. This includes adding/removing faces and adding/removing persons.
- For the free tier subscription, it can hold up to 1000 Persons. For S0 paid subscription, it can have up to 10,000 Persons.  

 **PersonGroupPerson** represents a person to be identified. It can hold up to 248 faces.

### Large Person Group 

**LargePersonGroup** is a later data structure introduced to support up to 1 million entities (for S0 tier subscription). It is optimized to support large-scale data. It shares most of **PersonGroup** features: A recognition model needs to be specified at creation time, and the Train API must be called before use.



### Person Directory 

**PersonDirectory** is the newest data structure of this kind. It supports a larger scale and higher accuracy. Each Azure Face resource has a single default **PersonDirectory** data structure. It's a flat list of **PersonDirectoryPerson** objects - it can hold up to 75 million.

**PersonDirectoryPerson** represents a person to be identified. Updated from the **PersonGroupPerson** model, it allows you to add faces from different recognition models to the same person. However, the Identify operation can only match faces obtained with the same recognition model. 

**DynamicPersonGroup** is a lightweight data structure that allows you to dynamically reference a **PersonGroupPerson**. It doesn't require the Train operation: once the data is updated, it's ready to be used with the Identify API.

You can also use an **in-place person ID list** for the Identify operation. This lets you specify a more narrow group to identify from. You can do this manually to improve identification performance in large groups. 

The above data structures can be used together. For example: 
- In an access control system, The **PersonDirectory** might represent all employees of a company, but a smaller **DynamicPersonGroup** could represent just the employees that have access to a single floor of the building.
- In a flight onboarding system, the **PersonDirectory** could represent all customers of the airline company, but the **DynamicPersonGroup** represents just the passengers on a particular flight. An **in-place person ID list** could represent the passengers who made a last-minute change.

For more details, please refer to the [PersonDirectory how-to guide](./how-to/use-persondirectory.md).

## Data structures used with Find Similar 

Unlike the Identify API, the Find Similar API is designed to be used in applications where the enrollment of **Person** is hard to set up (for example, face images captured from video analysis, or from a photo album analysis).

### FaceList 

**FaceList** represent a flat list of persisted faces. It can hold up 1,000 faces.

### LargeFaceList 

**LargeFaceList** is a later version which can hold up to 1,000,000 faces.

## Next steps

Now that you're familiar with the face data structures, write a script that uses them in the Identify operation.
