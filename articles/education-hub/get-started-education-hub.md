# Getting started with the Azure Education Hub

The first time you open the Azure Education Hub (such as by selecting the **Get Started** link in the invitation email), the **Get Started** page appears. There, you can find information about how to set up your course, learn about services, or easily deploy your first services through Azure quickstart templates.
