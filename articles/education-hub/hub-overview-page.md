# Manage your academic grant in the Azure Education Hub

Your main landing page in the Azure Education Hub is the **Overview** page. This page contains all the relevant information about your academic grant, such as the number of classes that you established and your total running credit allocated and used from those classes. It also displays shortcuts to other benefits that the Education Hub provides: software, learning materials, and quickstart templates.

## Overview page
