# Create an assignment and allocate credit in the Azure Education Hub

After you set up a course in the Azure Education Hub, you can create an assignment where you allocate credit and invite selected students to your course.

## Prerequisites

- An academic grant with an approved credit amount
- A course created in the Education Hub
- A work or school account and a subscription within the course that will access your Azure credit

### Accounts

The Education Hub accepts any email address in the standard format. It does *not* currently check for a valid account in your organization or whether the Microsoft account is current or valid. Carefully check each email address before you continue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work and school accounts are subject to their own policies, including whether an email address from a domain other than the organization is permitted (for example, adding *student*@outlook.com to the @*school*.edu domain). Be sure to check these policies before you add new users.

When you add a work or school account (for example, *student*@*school*.edu) by using role-based access control (RBAC) in the Educator Sponsor Portal or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Azure automatically sends email to the recipient. This email requires the user to accept the new account and Azure role before receiving access to the subscription.

If you're a teaching assistant or a professor for a course, be sure to inform students of this requirement so that their subscription appears in the Azure portal as expected. The email should look similar to this example:

## Create an assignment and invite students to the course

1. Choose the amount of funds to credit to the student's subscription. If not all students will receive the same amount, you can select **Change** and apply a custom amount to each student or project group.

1. Select **Create assignment**.
1. Optionally, you can remove existing students by selecting **Remove** next to each student's name.
1. When you finish, select the **Close** button. The additional permissions appear on the **Sponsor Credit Management** page.
