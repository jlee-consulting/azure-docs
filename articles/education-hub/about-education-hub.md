# What is the Azure Education Hub?

The Microsoft Azure [Education Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/quickstart) is a tool that helps academic users provision and manage cloud credit across Azure subscriptions.

This tool is useful when you need to manage many cloud-based student projects. The Education Hub is also useful for research purposes when you don't yet know your Azure credit needs.

You can easily adjust the amount of allocated credit within each subscription or in bulk. You can also suspend subscriptions to maximize available credits. For example, you might suspend subscriptions when a semester or quarter project is complete.

## Prerequisites

To access the Education Hub, you must first receive an email notification that confirms your approval for an academic grant and contains your approved credit amount.
