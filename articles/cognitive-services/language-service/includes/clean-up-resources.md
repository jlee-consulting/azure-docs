## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
