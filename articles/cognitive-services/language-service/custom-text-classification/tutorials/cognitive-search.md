# Tutorial: Enrich Cognitive Search index with custom classes from your data

With the abundance of electronic documents within the enterprise, the problem of search through them becomes a tiring and expensive task. [Azure Cognitive Search](../../../../search/search-create-service-portal.md) helps with searching through your files based on their indices. Custom text classification helps in enriching the indexing of these files by classifying them into your custom classes.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Create a custom text classification project.
* Publish Azure function.
* Add Index to your Azure Cognitive search.

## Prerequisites

* [An Azure Language resource connected to an Azure blob storage account](../how-to/create-project.md).
    * We recommend following the instructions for creating a resource using the Azure portal, for easier setup. 
* [An Azure Cognitive Search service](../../../../search/search-create-service-portal.md) in your current subscription
    * You can use any tier, and any region for this service.
* An [Azure function app](../../../../azure-functions/functions-create-function-app-portal.md)

## Upload sample data to blob container

[!INCLUDE [Uploading sample data for custom NER](../includes/quickstarts/blob-storage-upload.md)]

# [Language studio](#tab/Language-studio)

## Create a custom text classification project

Once your resource and storage container are configured, create a new custom text classification project. A project is a work area for building your custom ML models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Language resource being used.

[!INCLUDE [Create a project using Language Studio](../includes/language-studio/create-project.md)]

## Train your model

Typically after you create a project, you go ahead and start [tagging the documents](../how-to/tag-data.md) you have in the container connected to your project. For this tutorial, you have imported a sample tagged dataset and initialized your project with the sample JSON tags file.

[!INCLUDE [Train a model using Language Studio](../includes/language-studio/train-model.md)]

## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review it's [evaluation details](../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) and [make improvements](../how-to/improve-model.md) if necessary. In this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try in Language Studio, or you can call the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).

[!INCLUDE [Deploy a model using Language Studio](../includes/language-studio/deploy-model.md)]


# [REST APIs](#tab/REST-APIs)

### Get your resource keys and endpoint

[!INCLUDE [Get keys and endpoint Azure Portal](../includes/get-keys-endpoint-azure.md)]

## Create a custom text classification project

Once your resource and storage container are configured, create a new custom text classification project. A project is a work area for building your custom ML models based on your data. Your project can only be accessed by you and others who have access to the Language resource being used.

### Trigger import project job 

[!INCLUDE [Import a project using the REST API](../includes/rest-api/import-project.md)]

### Get import job Status

 [!INCLUDE [get import project status](../includes/rest-api/get-import-status.md)]

## Train your model

Typically after you create a project, you go ahead and start [tagging the documents](../how-to/tag-data.md) you have in the container connected to your project. For this tutorial, you have imported a sample tagged dataset and initialized your project with the sample JSON tags file.

### Start training your model

After your project has been imported, you can start training your model. 

[!INCLUDE [train model](../includes/rest-api/train-model.md)]

### Get training job status

Training could take sometime between 10 and 30 minutes for this sample dataset. You can use the following request to keep polling the status of the training job until it is successfully completed.

 [!INCLUDE [get training model status](../includes/rest-api/get-training-status.md)]

## Deploy your model

Generally after training a model you would review it's [evaluation details](../how-to/view-model-evaluation.md) and [make improvements](../how-to/improve-model.md) if necessary. In this quickstart, you will just deploy your model, and make it available for you to try in Language Studio, or you can call the [prediction API](https://aka.ms/ct-runtime-swagger).

### Submit deployment job

[!INCLUDE [deploy model](../includes/rest-api/deploy-model.md)]

### Get deployment job status

[!INCLUDE [get deployment status](../includes/rest-api/get-deployment-status.md)]

## Use CogSvc language utilities tool for Cognitive search integration
 
### Publish your Azure Function

1. Download and use the [provided sample function](https://aka.ms/CustomTextAzureFunction).

2. After you download the sample function, open the *program.cs* file in Visual Studio and [publish the function to Azure](../../../../azure-functions/functions-develop-vs.md?tabs=in-process#publish-to-azure).

### Prepare configuration file

1. Download [sample configuration file](https://aka.ms/CognitiveSearchIntegrationToolAssets) and open it in a text editor. 

2. Get your storage account connection string by:
    
    1. Navigating to your storage account overview page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home). 
    2. In the **Access Keys** section in the menu to the left of the screen, copy your **Connection string** to the `connectionString` field in the configuration file, under `blobStorage`.
    3. Go to the container where you have the files you want to index and copy container name to the `containerName` field in the configuration file, under `blobStorage`. 

3. Get your cognitive search endpoint and keys by:
    
    1. Navigating to your resource overview page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
    2. Copy the **Url** at the top-right section of the page to the `endpointUrl` field within `cognitiveSearch`.
    3. Go to the **Keys** section in the menu to the left of the screen. Copy your **Primary admin key** to the `apiKey` field within `cognitiveSearch`.

4. Get Azure Function endpoint and keys
   
    1. To get your Azure Function endpoint and keys, go to your function overview page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
    2. Go to **Functions** menu on the left of the screen, and click on the function you created.
    3. From the top menu, click **Get Function Url**. The URL will be formatted like this: `YOUR-ENDPOINT-URL?code=YOUR-API-KEY`. 
    4. Copy `YOUR-ENDPOINT-URL` to the `endpointUrl` field in the configuration file, under `azureFunction`. 
    5. Copy `YOUR-API-KEY` to the `apiKey` field in the configuration file, under `azureFunction`. 

5. Get your resource keys endpoint

   [!INCLUDE [Get keys and endpoint Azure Portal](../includes/get-keys-endpoint-azure.md)]

6. Get your custom text classification project secrets

    1. You will need your **project-name**, project names are case-sensitive. Project names can be found in **project settings** page.

    2. You will also need the **deployment-name**. Deployment names can be found in **Deploying a model** page.

### Run the indexer command

After youâ€™ve published your Azure function and prepared your configs file, you can run the indexer command.
```cli
    indexer index --index-name <name-your-index-here> --configs <absolute-path-to-configs-file>
```

Replace `name-your-index-here` with the index name that appears in your Cognitive Search instance.
