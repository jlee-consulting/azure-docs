To start training your model from within the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio):

1. Select **Train model** from the left side menu.

2. Select **Start a training job** from the top menu.

3. Select **Train a new model** and type in the model name in the text box. You can also **overwrite an existing model** by selecting this option and choosing the model you want to overwrite from the dropdown menu. Overwriting a trained model is irreversible, but it won't affect your deployed models until you deploy the new model.

4. Select training mode. You can choose **Standard training** for faster training, but it is only available for English. Or you can choose **Advanced training** which is supported for other languages and multilingual projects, but it involves longer training times. Learn more about [training modes](../../how-to/train-model.md#training-modes).
    

5. Select a [data splitting](../../how-to/train-model.md#data-splitting) method. You can choose **Automatically splitting the testing set from training data** where the system will split your utterances between the training and testing sets, according to the specified percentages. Or you can **Use a manual split of training and testing data**, this option is only enabled if you have added utterances to your testing set when you [labeled your utterances](../../how-to/tag-utterances.md). 

6. Click on the **Train** button.

5. Click on the Training Job ID from the list, a side pane will appear where you can check **Training progress** and **Job status** and other details for this job.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * Only successfully completed training jobs will generate models.
    > * Training can take some time between a couple of minutes and couple of hours based on the count of utterances.
    > * You can only have one training job running at a time. You can't start other training job within the same project until the running job is completed.
