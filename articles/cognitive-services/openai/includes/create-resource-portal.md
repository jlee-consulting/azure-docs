## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
- Access granted to the service in the desired Azure subscription. This service is currently invite only. You can fill out a new use case request here: <https://aka.ms/oai/access>.

## Create a resource

Resources in Azure can be created several different ways:

- Within the Azure portal
- Using the REST APIs, Azure CLI, PowerShell or client libraries
- Via ARM templates

This guide walks you through the Azure portal creation experience.

1. Navigate to the create page: [Azure OpenAI Service Create Page](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=microsoft_openai_tip#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesOpenAI)
1. On the **Create** page provide the following information:

    |Field| Description   |
    |--|--|
    | **Subscription** | Select the Azure subscription used in your OpenAI onboarding application|
    | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your OpenAI resource. You can create a new group or add it to a pre-existing group. |
    | **Region** | The location of your instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource.|
    | **Name** | A descriptive name for your cognitive services resource. For example, *MyOpenAIResource*. |
    | **Pricing Tier** | Only 1 pricing tier is available for the service currently |

## Deploy a model

Before you can generate text or inference, you need to deploy a model. This is done by selecting **create new deployment** on the **deployments** page. From here, you can select from one of our many available models. For getting started, we recommend `text-davinci-002` for users in South Central and `text-davinci-001` for users in West Europe (text-davinci-002 is not available in this region). You can do this in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

1. Go to the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com)

1. Login with the resource you want to use

1. Select the **Go to Deployments** button under **Manage deployments in your resource** to navigate to the **Deployments** page

    :::image type="content" source="../media/create-resource/deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure OpenAI Studio page with the 'Go to Deployments' button highlighted." lightbox="../media/create-resource/deployment.png":::

1. Create a new deployment called `text-davinci-002` and choose the `text-davinci-002` model from the drop-down.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Text-davinci-002 is only available in South Central US. If you are in a different region, please choose `text-davinci-001`.
