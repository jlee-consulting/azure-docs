## Select synthesis language and voice

The text-to-speech feature in the Azure Speech service supports more than 270 voices and more than 110 languages and variants. You can get the [full list](../../../language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices) or try them in a [text-to-speech demo](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features).

Specify the language or voice of `SpeechConfig` to match your input text and use the wanted voice:

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    // Set either the `SpeechSynthesisVoiceName` or `SpeechSynthesisLanguage`.
    speechConfig.speechSynthesisLanguage = "en-US"; 
    speechConfig.speechSynthesisVoiceName = "en-US-JennyNeural";
}

synthesizeSpeech();
```

All neural voices are multilingual and fluent in their own language and English. For example, if the input text in English is "I'm excited to try text to speech" and you set `es-ES-ElviraNeural`, the text is spoken in English with a Spanish accent. If the voice does not speak the language of the input text, the Speech service won't output synthesized audio. See the [full list](../../../language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices) of supported neural voices.

> [!NOTE]
> The default voice is the first voice returned per locale via the [Voice List API](../../../rest-text-to-speech.md#get-a-list-of-voices).

The voice that speaks is determined in order of priority as follows:
- If you don't set `SpeechSynthesisVoiceName` or `SpeechSynthesisLanguage`, the default voice for `en-US` will speak. 
- If you only set `SpeechSynthesisLanguage`, the default voice for the specified locale will speak. 
- If both `SpeechSynthesisVoiceName` and `SpeechSynthesisLanguage` are set, the `SpeechSynthesisLanguage` setting is ignored. The voice that you specified via `SpeechSynthesisVoiceName` will speak.
- If the voice element is set via [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)](../../../speech-synthesis-markup.md), the `SpeechSynthesisVoiceName` and `SpeechSynthesisLanguage` settings are ignored.

## Synthesize text to speech

# [browserjs](#tab/browserjs)

In some cases, you might want to output synthesized speech directly to a speaker. To do this, instantiate `AudioConfig` by using the `fromDefaultSpeakerOutput()` static function. This action outputs to the current active output device.

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromDefaultSpeakerOutput();

    const synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    synthesizer.speakTextAsync(
        "Synthesizing directly to speaker output.",
        result => {
            if (result) {
                synthesizer.close();
                return result.audioData;
            }
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

Run the program. A synthesized audio is played from the speaker. This is a good example of the most basic usage. Next, you look at customizing output and handling the output response as an in-memory stream for working with custom scenarios.

# [nodejs](#tab/nodejs)

Next, you create a [`SpeechSynthesizer`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesizer) object. This object executes text-to-speech conversions and outputs to speakers, files, or other output streams. `SpeechSynthesizer` accepts as parameters:

- The [`SpeechConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig) object that you created in the previous step
- An [`AudioConfig`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/audioconfig) object that specifies how output results should be handled

To start, create an `AudioConfig` instance to automatically write the output to a .wav file by using the `fromAudioFileOutput()` static function:

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromAudioFileOutput("path/to/file.wav");
}
```

Next, instantiate a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance. Pass your `speechConfig` and `audioConfig` objects as parameters. Now, writing synthesized speech to a file is as simple as running `speakTextAsync()` with a string of text. The result callback is a great place to call `synthesizer.close()`. The call to `synthesizer.close()` is needed for synthesis to function correctly.

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromAudioFileOutput("path-to-file.wav");

    const synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    synthesizer.speakTextAsync(
        "A simple test to write to a file.",
        result => {
            synthesizer.close();
            if (result) {
                // return result as stream
                return fs.createReadStream("path-to-file.wav");
            }
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

Run the program. Synthesized speech is written to a .wav file in the location that you specified.

## Get a result as an in-memory stream

# [browserjs](#tab/browserjs)

For many scenarios in speech application development, you likely need the resulting audio data as an in-memory stream rather than directly writing to a file. This will allow you to build custom behavior, including:

* Abstract the resulting byte array as a seekable stream for custom downstream services.
* Integrate the result with other APIs or services.
* Modify the audio data, write custom `.wav` headers, and do related tasks.

It's simple to make this change from the previous example. First, remove the `AudioConfig` block, because you'll manage the output behavior manually from this point onward for increased control. Then pass `null` for `AudioConfig` in the `SpeechSynthesizer` constructor.

> [!NOTE]
> Passing `null` for `AudioConfig`, rather than omitting it as you did in the previous speaker output example, will not play the audio by default on the current active output device.

This time, you save the result to a [`SpeechSynthesisResult`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesisresult) variable. The `SpeechSynthesisResult.audioData` property returns an `ArrayBuffer` value of the output data, the default browser stream type. For server-side code, convert `ArrayBuffer` to a buffer stream.

The following code works for the client side:

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const synthesizer = new sdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig);

    synthesizer.speakTextAsync(
        "Getting the response as an in-memory stream.",
        result => {
            synthesizer.close();
            return result.audioData;
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

From here, you can implement any custom behavior by using the resulting `ArrayBuffer` object. `ArrayBuffer` is a common type to receive in a browser and play from this format.

For any server-based code, if you need to work with the data as a stream, you need to convert the `ArrayBuffer` object into a stream:

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const synthesizer = new sdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig);

    synthesizer.speakTextAsync(
        "Getting the response as an in-memory stream.",
        result => {
            const { audioData } = result;

            synthesizer.close();

            // convert arrayBuffer to stream
            // return stream
            const bufferStream = new PassThrough();
            bufferStream.end(Buffer.from(audioData));
            return bufferStream;
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

        result => {

            synthesizer.close();

            // convert arrayBuffer to stream
            const bufferStream = new PassThrough();
            bufferStream.end(Buffer.from(audioData));
            return bufferStream;
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

## Customize audio format

You can customize audio output attributes, including:

* Audio file type
* Sample rate
* Bit depth

To change the audio format, you use the `speechSynthesisOutputFormat` property on the `SpeechConfig` object. This property expects an `enum` instance of type [`SpeechSynthesisOutputFormat`](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesisoutputformat), which you use to select the output format. See the [list of audio formats](/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesisoutputformat) that are available.

There are various options for different file types, depending on your requirements. By definition, raw formats like `Raw24Khz16BitMonoPcm` don't include audio headers. Use raw formats only in one of these situations:

- You know that your downstream implementation can decode a raw bitstream.
- You plan to manually build headers based on factors like bit depth, sample rate, and number of channels.

In this example, you specify the high-fidelity RIFF format `Riff24Khz16BitMonoPcm` by setting `speechSynthesisOutputFormat` on the `SpeechConfig` object. Similar to the example in the previous section, get the audio `ArrayBuffer` data and interact with it.

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");

    // Set the output format
    speechConfig.speechSynthesisOutputFormat = sdk.SpeechSynthesisOutputFormat.Riff24Khz16BitMonoPcm;

    const synthesizer = new sdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, null);
    synthesizer.speakTextAsync(
        "Customizing audio output format.",
        result => {
            // Interact with the audio ArrayBuffer data
            const audioData = result.audioData;
            console.log(`Audio data byte size: ${audioData.byteLength}.`)

            synthesizer.close();
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

## Use SSML to customize speech characteristics

You can use SSML to fine-tune the pitch, pronunciation, speaking rate, volume, and more in the text-to-speech output by submitting your requests from an XML schema. This section shows an example of changing the voice. For a more detailed guide, see the [SSML how-to article](../../../speech-synthesis-markup.md).

To start using SSML for customization, you make a simple change that switches the voice.

First, create a new XML file for the SSML configuration in your root project directory. In this example, it's `ssml.xml`. The root element is always `<speak>`. Wrapping the text in a `<voice>` element allows you to change the voice by using the `name` parameter. See the [full list](../../../language-support.md#prebuilt-neural-voices) of supported *neural* voices.

```xml
<speak version="1.0" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US">
  <voice name="en-US-JennyNeural">
    When you're on the freeway, it's a good idea to use a GPS.
  </voice>
</speak>
```

Next, you need to change the speech synthesis request to reference your XML file. The request is mostly the same, but instead of using the `speakTextAsync()` function, you use `speakSsmlAsync()`. This function expects an XML string, so first you create a function to load an XML file and return it as a string:

```javascript
function xmlToString(filePath) {
    const xml = readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");
    return xml;
}
```

For more information on `readFileSync`, see <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readlinksync_path_options" target="_blank">Node.js file system</a>. From here, the result object is exactly the same as previous examples:

```javascript
function synthesizeSpeech() {
    const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription("<paste-your-speech-key-here>", "<paste-your-speech-location/region-here>");
    const synthesizer = new sdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, null);

    const ssml = xmlToString("ssml.xml");
    synthesizer.speakSsmlAsync(
        ssml,
        result => {
            if (result.errorDetails) {
                console.error(result.errorDetails);
            } else {
                console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
            }

            synthesizer.close();
        },
        error => {
            console.log(error);
            synthesizer.close();
        });
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To change the voice without using SSML, you can set the property on `SpeechConfig` by using `SpeechConfig.speechSynthesisVoiceName = "en-US-JennyNeural";`.
