## Set up the environment

Check whether there are any [platform-specific installation steps](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-go).

You must also install [GStreamer](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md) for compressed input audio.

## Create captions from speech

Follow these steps to create a new GO module and install the Speech SDK.

1. Download or copy the <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/scenarios/go/captioning/"  title="Copy the samples"  target="_blank">scenarios/go/captioning/</a> sample files from GitHub into a local directory. 
1. Open a command prompt in the same directory as `captioning.go`.
1. Run the following commands to create a `go.mod` file that links to the Speech SDK components hosted on GitHub:
    ```console
    go mod init captioning
    go get github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go
    ```
1. Build the GO module.
    ```console
    go build
    ```
1. Run the application with your preferred command line arguments. See [usage and arguments](#usage-and-arguments) for the available options. Here is an example:
    ```console
    go run captioning --key YourSubscriptionKey --region YourServiceRegion --input caption.this.mp4 --format any --output caption.output.txt - --srt --recognizing --threshold 5 --profanity mask --phrases "Contoso;Jessie;Rehaan"
    ```
    Replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key, and replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource [region](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions.md), such as `westus` or `northeurope`. Make sure that the paths specified by `--input` and `--output` are valid. Otherwise you must change the paths.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). See the Cognitive Services [security](../../../../cognitive-services-security.md) article for more information.

    The output file with complete captions is written to `caption.output.txt`. Intermediate results are shown in the console:
    ```console
    00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,600

    ```
