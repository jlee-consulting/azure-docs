> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the most recent LTS release of the Linux distribution. For example, if you are using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, use the latest release of Ubuntu 20.04.X.

For a native application, the Speech SDK relies on `libMicrosoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.so`. Make sure the target architecture (x86, x64) matches the application. Depending on the Linux version, more dependencies might be required:

- The shared libraries of the GNU C library, including the POSIX Threads Programming library, `libpthreads`
- The OpenSSL library (`libssl`) version 1.x
- The shared library for ALSA applications (`libasound`)

# [Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04](#tab/ubuntu)

```Bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libasound2 wget
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Ubuntu 22.04, install `libssl1.1` either as a [binary package](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/) such as `libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3_amd64.deb`, or by compiling it from sources. The Speech SDK does not support OpenSSL 3.0, which is the default in Ubuntu 22.04.

Here's an example of installing `libssl1.1` on Ubuntu 22.04:
```Bash
wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.3_amd64.deb
```

# [Debian 9/10/11](#tab/debian)

To use the Speech SDK in Alpine Linux, create a Debian chroot environment as documented in the Alpine Linux Wiki on [running glibc programs](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs). Then follow the Debian instructions here.

```Bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libasound2 wget
```

# [RHEL 7/8 and CentOS 7/8](#tab/rhel-centos)

Install the development tools and libraries:

```Bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"
sudo yum install alsa-lib openssl wget
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - On RHEL/CentOS 7, follow the instructions on [how to configure RHEL/CentOS 7 for Speech SDK](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-rhel-centos-7.md).
> - On RHEL/CentOS 8, follow the instructions on [how to configure OpenSSL for Linux](~/articles/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).
