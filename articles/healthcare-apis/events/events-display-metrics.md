# How to display Events metrics

In this article, you'll learn how to display Events metrics in the Azure portal. 

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this article, an Azure Event Hubs event hub was used as the Events message endpoint. 

## Display metrics

1. Within your Azure Health Data Services workspace, select the **Events** button.

2. The Events page displays the combined metrics for all Events Subscriptions. For example, we have one subscription named  **fhir-events** and one processed message. Select the subscription in the lower left-hand corner to view the metrics for that subscription.

3. From this page, you'll notice that the subscription named **fhir-events** has one processed message. To view the Event Hubs metrics, select the name of the Event Hubs (for this example, **azuredocsfhirservice**) from the lower right-hand corner of the page.

   :::image type="content" source="media\events-display-metrics\events-metrics-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the metrics button." lightbox="media\events-display-metrics\events-metrics-subscription.png"::: 

4. From this page, you'll notice that the Event Hubs received the incoming message presented in the previous Events subscription metrics pages.
