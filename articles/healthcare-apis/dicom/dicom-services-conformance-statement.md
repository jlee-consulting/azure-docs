# DICOM Conformance Statement

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM supports a subset of the DICOMwebâ„¢ Standard. Support includes:

* [Studies Service](#studies-service)
    * [Store (STOW-RS)](#store-stow-rs)
    * [Retrieve (WADO-RS)](#retrieve-wado-rs)
    * [Search (QIDO-RS)](#search-qido-rs)
    * [Delete](#delete)
* [Worklist Service (UPS Push and Pull SOPs)](#worklist-service-ups-rs)
    * [Create Workitem](#create-workitem)
    * [Retrieve Workitem](#retrieve-workitem)
    * [Update Workitem](#update-workitem)
    * [Change Workitem State](#change-workitem-state)
    * [Request Cancellation](#request-cancellation)
    * [Search Workitems](#search-workitems)

Additionally, the following non-standard API(s) are supported:

* [Change Feed](dicom-change-feed-overview.md)
* [Extended Query Tags](dicom-extended-query-tags-overview.md)

The service uses REST API versioning. The version of the REST API must be explicitly specified as part of the base URL, as in the following example:

`https://<service_url>/v<version>/studies`

For more information on how to specify the version when making requests, see the [API Versioning Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

You'll find example requests for supported transactions in the [Postman collection](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/blob/main/docs/resources/Conformance-as-Postman.postman_collection.json).

## Preamble Sanitization

The service ignores the 128-byte File Preamble, and replaces its contents with null characters. This ensures that no files passed through the service are vulnerable to the [malicious preamble vulnerability](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part10/sect_7.5.html). However, this also means that [preambles used to encode dual format content](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6489422/) such as TIFF can't be used with the service.

## Studies Service

The [Studies Service](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#chapter_10) allows users to store, retrieve, and search for DICOM Studies, Series, and Instances. We've added the non-standard Delete transaction to enable a full resource lifecycle.

### Store (STOW-RS)

This transaction uses the POST method to store representations of studies, series, and instances contained in the request payload.

| Method | Path               | Description |
| :----- | :----------------- | :---------- |
| POST   | ../studies         | Store instances. |
| POST   | ../studies/{study} | Store instances for a specific study. |

Parameter `study` corresponds to the DICOM attribute StudyInstanceUID. If it's specified, any instance that doesn't belong to the provided study will be rejected with a `43265` warning code.

The following `Accept` header(s) for the response are supported:

* `application/dicom+json`

The following `Content-Type` header(s) are supported:

* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* `application/dicom`

> [!NOTE]
> The Server **will not** coerce or replace attributes that conflict with existing data. All data will be stored as provided.

The following DICOM elements are required to be present in every DICOM file attempting to be stored:

* `StudyInstanceUID`
* `SeriesInstanceUID`
* `SOPInstanceUID`
* `SOPClassUID`
* `PatientID`

> [!NOTE]
> All identifiers must be between 1 and 64 characters long, and only contain alpha numeric characters or the following special characters: `.`, `-`.

Each file stored must have a unique combination of `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, and `SopInstanceUID`. The warning code `45070` will be returned if a file with the same identifiers already exists.

Only transfer syntaxes with explicit Value Representations are accepted.

#### Store response status codes

| Code      | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `200 (OK)`                     | All the SOP instances in the request have been stored. |
| `202 (Accepted)`               | Some instances in the request have been stored but others have failed. |
| `204 (No Content)`             | No content was provided in the store transaction request. |
| `400 (Bad Request)`            | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier didn't conform to the expected UID format. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)`           | The client isnn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
| `406 (Not Acceptable)`         | The specified `Accept` header isn't supported. |
| `409 (Conflict)`               | None of the instances in the store transaction request have been stored. |
| `415 (Unsupported Media Type)` | The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)`    | The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later. |

### Store response payload

The response payload will populate a DICOM dataset with the following elements:

| Tag          | Name                  | Description |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :---------- |
| (0008, 1190) | `RetrieveURL`           | The Retrieve URL of the study if the StudyInstanceUID was provided in the store request and at least one instance is successfully stored. |
| (0008, 1198) | `FailedSOPSequence`     | The sequence of instances that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1199) | `ReferencedSOPSequence` | The sequence of stored instances. |

Each dataset in the `FailedSOPSequence` will have the following elements (if the DICOM file attempting to be stored could be read):

| Tag          | Name                     | Description |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :---------- |
| (0008, 1150) | `ReferencedSOPClassUID`    | The SOP class unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1155) | `ReferencedSOPInstanceUID` | The SOP instance unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1197) | `FailureReason`            | The reason code why this instance failed to store. |

Each dataset in the `ReferencedSOPSequence` will have the following elements:

| Tag          | Name                     | Description |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :---------- |
| (0008, 1150) | `ReferencedSOPClassUID`    | The SOP class unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |

      }
    }]
  }
}
```

#### Store failure reason codes

| Code  | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `272`   | The store transaction didn't store the instance because of a general failure in processing the operation. |
| `43264` | The DICOM instance failed the validation. |
| `43265` | The provided instance `StudyInstanceUID` didn't match the specified `StudyInstanceUID` in the store request. |
| `45070` | A DICOM instance with the same `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, and `SopInstanceUID` has already been stored. If you wish to update the contents, delete this instance first. |
| `45071` | A DICOM instance is being created by another process, or the previous attempt to create has failed and the cleanup process hasn't had chance to clean up yet. Delete the instance first before attempting to create again. |

### Retrieve (WADO-RS)

#### Retrieve instances within study or series

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for retrieving instances within a study or a series:

* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom";` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90`

#### Retrieve an Instance

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for retrieving a specific instance:

* `application/dicom; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `application/dicom;` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.1` is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.1` is used as default)
* `application/dicom; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`

#### Retrieve Frames

The following `Accept` headers are supported for retrieving frames:

* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=*`
* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream";` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.1` is used as default)
* `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1`
* `multipart/related; type="image/jp2";` (when transfer-syntax isn't specified, `1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90` is used as default)

#### Retrieve transfer syntax

When the requested transfer syntax is different from original file, the original file is transcoded to requested transfer syntax. The original file needs to be one of the formats below for transcoding to succeed; otherwise, transcoding may fail:

* 1.2.840.10008.1.2 (Little Endian Implicit)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (Little Endian Explicit)

* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 (JPEG Lossless Selection Value 1)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 (JPEG 2000 Lossless Only)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91 (JPEG 2000)
* 1.2.840.10008.1.2.5 (RLE Lossless)

An unsupported `transfer-syntax` will result in `406 Not Acceptable`.

### Retrieve metadata (for study, series, or instance)

The following `Accept` header is supported for retrieving metadata for a study, a series, or an instance:

* `application/dicom+json`

Retrieving metadata will not return attributes with the following value representations:

| VR Name | Description            |
| :------ | :--------------------- |
| OB      | Other Byte             |
| OD      | Other Double           |

| OW      | Other Word             |
| UN      | Unknown                |

### Retrieve metadata cache validation for (study, series, or instance)

Cache validation is supported using the `ETag` mechanism. In the response to a metadata request, ETag is returned as one of the headers. This ETag can be cached and added as `If-None-Match` header in the later requests for the same metadata. Two types of responses are possible if the data exists:

* Data hasn't changed since the last request: `HTTP 304 (Not Modified)` response will be sent with no response body.
* Data has changed since the last request: `HTTP 200 (OK)` response will be sent with updated ETag. Required data will also be returned as part of the body.

### Retrieve response status codes

| Code                         | Description |
| :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| `200 (OK)`                     | All requested data has been retrieved. |
| `304 (Not Modified)`           | The requested data hasn't been modified since the last request. Content isn't added to the response body in such case. For more information, see the above section **Retrieve Metadata Cache Validation (for Study, Series, or Instance)**. |
| `400 (Bad Request)`            | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier didn't conform to the expected UID format, or the requested transfer-syntax encoding isn't supported. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)`           | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)`              | The specified DICOM resource couldn't be found. |
| `406 (Not Acceptable)`         | The specified `Accept` header isn't supported. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)`    | The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later. |

### Search (QIDO-RS)

Query based on ID for DICOM Objects (QIDO) enables you to search for studies, series, and instances by attributes.

| Method | Path   | Description         |
| :----- | :----- | :------------------ |
| *Search for Studies*         |
| GET    | ../studies?...   | Search for studies   |
| *Search for Series*     |
| GET    | ../series?...    | Search for series   |
| GET    |../studies/{study}/series?...      | Search for series in a study      |
| *Search for Instances*       |
| GET    |../instances?...   | Search for instances  |
| GET    |../studies/{study}/instances?...   | Search for instances in a study   |
| GET    |../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances?... | Search for instances in a series  |

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for searching:

* `application/dicom+json`

### Supported search parameters

The following parameters for each query are supported:

| Key    | Support Value(s)    | Allowed Count | Description |
| :----- | :----- | :------------ | :---------- |
| `{attributeID}=` | `{value}`     | 0...N    | Search for attribute/ value matching in query. |
| `includefield=`  | `{attributeID}`<br/>`all`   | 0...N   | The additional attributes to return in the response. Both, public and private tags are supported.<br/>When `all` is provided. Refer to [Search Response](#search-response) for more information about which attributes will be returned for each query type.<br/>If a mixture of `{attributeID}` and `all` is provided, the server will default to using `all`. |
| `limit=`  | `{value}`  | 0..1   | Integer value to limit the number of values returned in the response.<br/>Value can be between the range 1 >= x <= 200. Defaulted to 100. |
| `offset=`     | `{value}`  | 0..1  | Skip `{value}` results.<br/>If an offset is provided larger than the number of search query results, a 204 (no content) response will be returned. |
| `fuzzymatching=` | `true` / `false`  | 0..1    | If true fuzzy matching is applied to PatientName attribute. It will do a prefix word match of any name part inside PatientName value. For example, if PatientName is "John^Doe", then "joh", "do", "jo do", "Doe" and "John Doe" will all match. However, "ohn" won't match. |

#### Searchable attributes

We support searching the following attributes and search types.

| Attribute Keyword | Study | Series | Instance |
| :---------------- | :---: | :----: | :------: |
| `StudyInstanceUID` | X | X | X |
| `PatientName` | X | X | X |
| `PatientID` | X | X | X |
| `PatientBirthDate` | X | X | X |
| `AccessionNumber` | X | X | X |
| `ReferringPhysicianName` | X | X | X |
| `StudyDate` | X | X | X |
| `StudyDescription` | X | X | X |
| `SeriesInstanceUID` |  | X | X |
| `Modality` |  | X | X |
| `PerformedProcedureStepStartDate` |  | X | X |
| `SOPInstanceUID` |  |  | X |

#### Search matching

We support the following matching types.

| Search Type | Supported Attribute | Example |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :------ |
| Range Query | `StudyDate`/`PatientBirthDate` | `{attributeID}={value1}-{value2}`. For date/ time values, we support an inclusive range on the tag. This will be mapped to `attributeID >= {value1} AND attributeID <= {value2}`. If `{value1}` isn't specified, all occurrences of dates/times prior to and including `{value2}` will be matched. Likewise, if `{value2}` isn't specified, all occurrences of `{value1}` and subsequent dates/times will be matched. However, one of these values has to be present. `{attributeID}={value1}-` and `{attributeID}=-{value2}` are valid, however, `{attributeID}=-` is invalid. |
| Exact Match | All supported attributes | `{attributeID}={value1}` |
| Fuzzy Match | `PatientName`, `ReferringPhysicianName` | Matches any component of the name which starts with the value. |

#### Attribute ID

Tags can be encoded in a number of ways for the query parameter. We've partially implemented the standard as defined in [PS3.18 6.7.1.1.1](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2019a/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html#sect_6.7.1.1.1). The following encodings for a tag are supported:

| Value            | Example          |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| `{group}{element}` | `0020000D`         |
| `{dicomKeyword}`   | `StudyInstanceUID` |

Example query searching for instances:

 `../instances?Modality=CT&00280011=512&includefield=00280010&limit=5&offset=0`

| :------------------------ | :---------- |
| `200 (OK)`                  | The response payload contains all the matching resources. |
| `204 (No Content)`          | The search completed successfully but returned no results. |
| `400 (Bad Request)`         | The server was unable to perform the query because the query component was invalid. Response body contains details of the failure. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)`        | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)` | The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later. |

### Additional notes

* Querying using the `TimezoneOffsetFromUTC (00080201)` isn't supported.
* The query API won't return `413 (request entity too large)`. If the requested query response limit is outside of the acceptable range, a bad request will be returned. Anything requested within the acceptable range, will be resolved.
* When target resource is Study/Series there's a potential for inconsistent study/series level metadata across multiple instances. For example, two instances could have different patientName. In this case, the latest will win and you can search only on the latest data.
* Paged results are optimized to return matched newest instance first, this may result in duplicate records in subsequent pages if newer data matching the query was added.
* Matching is case in-sensitive and accent in-sensitive for PN VR types.
* Matching is case in-sensitive and accent sensitive for other string VR types.
* Only the first value will be indexed of a single valued data element that incorrectly has multiple values.

### Delete

This transaction isn't part of the official DICOMweb&trade; Standard. It uses the DELETE method to remove representations of studies, series, and instances from the store.

| Method | Path       | Description |
| :----- | :--------- | :---------- |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}       | Delete all instances for a specific study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}   | Delete all instances for a specific series within a study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance} | Delete a specific instance within a series. |

Parameters `study`, `series`, and `instance` correspond to the DICOM attributes `StudyInstanceUID`, `SeriesInstanceUID`, and `SopInstanceUID` respectively.

There are no restrictions on the request's `Accept` header, `Content-Type` header or body content.

> [!NOTE]
> After a Delete transaction, the deleted instances will not be recoverable.

### Response Status Codes

| Code                         | Description |
| :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| `204 (No Content)`             | When all the SOP instances have been deleted. |
| `400 (Bad Request)`            | The request was badly formatted. |
| `401 (Unauthorized)`           | The client isn't authenticated. |
| `403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
| `404 (Not Found)`              | When the specified series wasn't found within a study or the specified instance wasn't found within the series. |
| `503 (Service Unavailable)`    | The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later. |

### Delete response payload

The response body will be empty. The status code is the only useful information returned.

## Worklist Service (UPS-RS)

The DICOM service supports the Push and Pull SOPs of the [Worklist Service (UPS-RS)](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#chapter_11). This service provides access to one Worklist containing Workitems, each of which represents a Unified Procedure Step (UPS).

Throughout, the variable `{workitem}` in a URI template stands for a Workitem UID.

Available UPS-RS endpoints include:

|Verb|	Path |	Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
|POST|	{s}/workitems{?AffectedSOPInstanceUID}|	Create a work item|
|POST|	{s}/workitems/{instance}{?transaction}|	Update a work item
|GET|	{s}/workitems{?query*}	| Search for work items
|GET|	{s}/workitems/{instance}|	Retrieve a work item
|PUT|	{s}/workitems/{instance}/state|	Change work item state
|POST|	{s}/workitems/{instance}/cancelrequest	| Cancel work item|
|POST	|{s}/workitems/{instance}/subscribers/{AETitle}{?deletionlock}	| Create subscription|
|POST|	{s}/workitems/1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.34.5/ |	Suspend subscription|
|DELETE	| {s}/workitems/{instance}/subscribers/{AETitle}	| Delete subscription
|GET |	{s}/subscribers/{AETitle}| Open subscription channel |

### Create Workitem

This transaction uses the POST method to create a new Workitem.

|Method|	Path	|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
| POST	|../workitems|	Create a Workitem.|
| POST	|../workitems?{workitem}|	Creates a Workitem with the specified UID.|

If not specified in the URI, the payload dataset must contain the Workitem in the `SOPInstanceUID` attribute.

The `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers are required in the request, and must both have the value `application/dicom+json`.

There are a number of requirements related to DICOM data attributes in the context of a specific transaction. Attributes may be required to be present, required to not be present, required to be empty, or required to not be empty. These requirements can be found [in this table](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3).

Notes on dataset attributes:

* **SOP Instance UID:** Although the reference table above says that SOP Instance UID shouldn't be present, this guidance is specific to the DIMSE protocol and is handled differently in DICOMWebâ„¢. SOP Instance UID should be present in the dataset if not in the URI.
* **Conditional requirement codes:** All the conditional requirement codes including 1C and 2C are treated as optional.

#### Create Response Status Codes

|Code	|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`201 (Created)`|	The target Workitem was successfully created.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`|	There was a problem with the request. For example, the request payload didn't satisfy the requirements above.|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`|	The client isn't authenticated.
|`403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
|`409 (Conflict)`	|The Workitem already exists.
|`415 (Unsupported Media Type)`|	The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported.
|`503 (Service Unavailable)`|	The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later.|

#### Create Response Payload

A success response will have no payload. The `Location` and `Content-Location` response headers will contain a URI reference to the created Workitem.

A failure response payload will contain a message describing the failure.

### Request Cancellation

This transaction enables the user to request cancellation of a non-owned Workitem.

There are [four valid Workitem states](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.1.1-1):

* `SCHEDULED`
* `IN PROGRESS`
* `CANCELED`
* `COMPLETED`

This transaction will only succeed against Workitems in the `SCHEDULED` state. Any user can claim ownership of a Workitem by setting its Transaction UID and changing its state to `IN PROGRESS`. From then on, a user can only modify the Workitem by providing the correct Transaction UID. While UPS defines Watch and Event SOP classes that allow cancellation requests and other events to be forwarded, this DICOM service does not implement these classes, and so cancellation requests on workitems that are `IN PROGRESS` will return failure. An owned Workitem can be canceled via the [Change Workitem State](#change-workitem-state) transaction.

|Method	|Path|	Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|POST	|../workitems/{workitem}/cancelrequest|	Request the cancellation of a scheduled Workitem|

The `Content-Type` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload may include Action Information as [defined in the DICOM Standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.2-1).

#### Request Cancellation Response Status Codes

|Code	|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`202 (Accepted)`|	The request was accepted by the server, but the Target Workitem state hasn't necessarily changed yet.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`|	There was a problem with the syntax of the request.|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`|	The client isn't authenticated.
|`403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
|`404 (Not Found)`|	The Target Workitem wasn't found.
|`409 (Conflict)`|	The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem. For example, the Target Workitem is in the **SCHEDULED** or **COMPLETED** state.
|`415 (Unsupported Media Type)`	|The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported.|

#### Request Cancellation Response Payload

A success response will have no payload, and a failure response payload will contain a message describing the failure. If the Workitem Instance is already in a canceled state, the response will include the following HTTP Warning header: `299: The UPS is already in the requested state of CANCELED.`

### Retrieve Workitem

This transaction retrieves a Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-GET operation.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.5

If the Workitem exists on the origin server, the Workitem shall be returned in an Acceptable Media Type. The returned Workitem shall not contain the Transaction UID (0008,1195) Attribute. This is necessary to preserve this Attribute's role as an access lock.

|Method	|Path	|Description
|:---|:---|:---|
|GET|	../workitems/{workitem}|	Request to retrieve a Workitem

The `Accept` header is required and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

#### Retrieve Workitem Response Status Codes

|Code	|Description|
|:--- |:---
|`200 (OK)`|	Workitem Instance was successfully retrieved.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`|	There was a problem with the request.|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`|	The client isn't authenticated.|
|`403 (Forbidden)`   | The user isn't authorized. |
|`404 (Not Found)`|	The Target Workitem wasn't found.|

#### Retrieve Workitem Response Payload

* A success response has a single part payload containing the requested Workitem in the Selected Media Type.
* The returned Workitem shall not contain the Transaction UID (0008, 1195) attribute of the Workitem, since that should only be known to the Owner.

### Update Workitem

This transaction modifies attributes of an existing Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-SET operation.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.6

To update a Workitem currently in the **SCHEDULED** state, the `Transaction UID` attribute shall not be present. For a Workitem in the **IN PROGRESS** state, the request must include the current Transaction UID as a query parameter. If the Workitem is already in the **COMPLETED** or **CANCELED** states, the response will be `400 (Bad Request)`.

|Method	|Path	|Description
|:---|:---|:---|
|POST|	../workitems/{workitem}?{transaction-uid}|	Update Workitem Transaction|

The `Content-Type` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload contains a dataset with the changes to be applied to the target Workitem. When modifying a sequence, the request must include all Items in the sequence, not just the Items to be modified. When multiple Attributes need updating as a group, do this as multiple Attributes in a single request, not as multiple requests.

There are a number of requirements related to DICOM data attributes in the context of a specific transaction. Attributes may be required to be present, required to not be present, required to be empty, or required to not be empty. These requirements can be found in this table.

Notes on dataset attributes:

* **Conditional requirement codes:** All the conditional requirement codes including 1C and 2C are treated as optional.

* The request can't set the value of the Procedure Step State (0074,1000) attribute. Procedure Step State is managed using the Change State transaction, or the Request Cancellation transaction.

#### Update Workitem Transaction Response Status Codes

|Code	|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`200 (OK)`|	The Target Workitem was updated.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`|	There was a problem with the request. For example: (1) the Target Workitem was in the `COMPLETED` or `CANCELED` state. (2) the Transaction UID is missing. (3) the Transaction UID is incorrect. (4) the dataset didn't conform to the requirements.|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`|	The client isn't authenticated.|
| `403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
|`404 (Not Found)`|	The Target Workitem wasn't found.|
|`409 (Conflict)`	|The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem.|
|`415 (Unsupported Media Type)`| The provided `Content-Type` isn't supported.|

#### Update Workitem Transaction Response Payload

The origin server shall support header fields as required in [Table 11.6.3-2](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#table_11.6.3-2).

A success response shall have either no payload or a payload containing a Status Report document.

A failure response payload may contain a Status Report describing any failures, warnings, or other useful information.

### Change Workitem State

This transaction is used to change the state of a Workitem. It corresponds to the UPS DIMSE N-ACTION operation "Change UPS State". State changes are used to claim ownership, complete, or cancel a Workitem.

Refer to: https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.7

If the Workitem exists on the origin server, the Workitem shall be returned in an Acceptable Media Type. The returned Workitem shall not contain the Transaction UID (0008,1195) attribute. This is necessary to preserve this attribute's role as an access lock, as described here.

|Method|	Path|	Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|PUT|	../workitems/{workitem}/state|Change Workitem State |

The `Accept` header is required, and must have the value `application/dicom+json`.

The request payload shall contain the Change UPS State Data Elements. These data elements are:

* **Transaction UID (0008, 1195)** The request payload shall include a Transaction UID. The user agent creates the Transaction UID when requesting a transition to the `IN PROGRESS` state for a given Workitem. The user agent provides that Transaction UID in subsequent transactions with that Workitem.
* **Procedure Step State (0074, 1000)** The legal values correspond to the requested state transition. They are: `IN PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELED`.

#### Change Workitem State Response Status Codes

|Code|	Description|
|:---|:---|
|`200 (OK)`|	Workitem Instance was successfully retrieved.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`	|The request cannot be performed for one of the following reasons: (1) the request is invalid given the current state of the Target Workitem. (2) the Transaction UID is missing. (3) the Transaction UID is incorrect|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`	|The client isn't authenticated.|
|`403 (Forbidden)`   | The user isn't authorized. |
|`404 (Not Found)`|	The Target Workitem wasn't found.|
|`409 (Conflict)`|	The request is inconsistent with the current state of the Target Workitem.|

#### Change Workitem State Response Payload

* Responses will include the header fields specified in [section 11.7.3.2](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_11.7.3.2).
* A success response shall have no payload.
* A failure response payload may contain a Status Report describing any failures, warnings, or other useful information.

### Search Workitems

This transaction enables you to search for Workitems by attributes.

|Method	|Path|	Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|GET|	../workitems?|	Search for Workitems|

The following `Accept` header(s) are supported for searching:

`application/dicom+json`

#### Supported Search Parameters

The following parameters for each query are supported:

|Key	|Support| Values|	Allowed| Count	|Description|
|:--- |:---   |:---   |:---    |:---    |:---|
|`{attributeID}=`|	`{value}`	|0...N	|Search for attribute/ value matching in query.
|`includefield=`	|`{attributeID} all`|	0...N	|The additional attributes to return in the response. Only top-level attributes can be specified to be included - not attributes that are part of sequences. Both public and private tags are supported. When `all` is provided, see [Search Response](#search-response) for more information about which attributes will be returned for each query type. If a mixture of `{attributeID}` and `all` is provided, the server will default to using 'all'.
|`limit=`|	`{value}`|	0...1|	Integer value to limit the number of values returned in the response. Value can be between the range `1 >= x <= 200`. Defaulted to `100`.|
|`offset=`|	`{value}`|	0...1|	Skip {value} results. If an offset is provided larger than the number of search query results, a `204 (no content)` response will be returned.
|`fuzzymatching=`	|`true/false`|	0...1	|If true fuzzy matching is applied to any attributes with the Person Name (PN) Value Representation (VR). It will do a prefix word match of any name part inside these attributes. For example, if `PatientName` is `John^Doe`, then `joh`, `do`, `jo do`, `Doe` and `John Doe` will all match. However `ohn` will **not** match.|

##### Searchable Attributes

We support searching on these attributes:

|Attribute Keyword|
|:---| 
|`PatientName`|
|`PatientID`|
|`ReferencedRequestSequence.AccessionNumber`|
|`ReferencedRequestSequence.RequestedProcedureID`|
|`ScheduledProcedureStepStartDateTime`|
|`ScheduledStationNameCodeSequence.CodeValue`|
|`ScheduledStationClassCodeSequence.CodeValue`|
|`ScheduledStationGeographicLocationCodeSequence.CodeValue`|
|`ProcedureStepState`|
|`StudyInstanceUID`|

##### Search Matching

We support these matching types:

|Search Type	|Supported Attribute|	Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Range Query|	`Scheduledâ€‹Procedureâ€‹Stepâ€‹Startâ€‹Dateâ€‹Time`|	`{attributeID}={value1}-{value2}`. For date/time values, we support an inclusive range on the tag. This will be mapped to `attributeID >= {value1}` AND `attributeID <= {value2}`. If `{value1}` isn't specified, all occurrences of dates/times prior to and including `{value2}` will be matched. Likewise, if `{value2}` isn't specified, all occurrences of `{value1}` and subsequent dates/times will be matched. However, one of these values has to be present. `{attributeID}={value1}-` and `{attributeID}=-{value2}` are valid, however, `{attributeID}=-` is invalid.
|Exact Match	|All supported attributes|	`{attributeID}={value1}`
|Fuzzy Match|	`PatientName`	|Matches any component of the name that starts with the value.

> [!NOTE]
> While we don't support full sequence matching, we do support exact match on the attributes listed above that are contained in a sequence.

##### Attribute ID

Tags can be encoded in a number of ways for the query parameter. We've partially implemented the standard as defined in [PS3.18 6.7.1.1.1](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2019a/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.7.html#sect_6.7.1.1.1). The following encodings for a tag are supported:

|Value	|Example|
|:---|:---|
|`{group}{element}`	|`00100010`|
|`{dicomKeyword}`	|`PatientName`|

Example query: 

`../workitems?PatientID=K123&0040A370.00080050=1423JS&includefield=00404005&limit=5&offset=0`

#### Search Response

The response will be an array of `0...N` DICOM datasets with the following attributes returned:

* All attributes in [DICOM PowerShell 3.4 Table CC.2.5-3](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3) with a Return Key Type of 1 or 2
* All attributes in [DICOM PowerShell 3.4 Table CC.2.5-3](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#table_CC.2.5-3) with a Return Key Type of 1C for which the conditional requirements are met
* All other Workitem attributes passed as match parameters
* All other Workitem attributes passed as includefield parameter values

#### Search Response Codes

The query API will return one of the following status codes in the response:

|Code	|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`200 (OK)`|	The response payload contains all the matching resource.|
|`206 (Partial Content)`	| The response payload contains only some of the search results, and the rest can be requested through the appropriate request.|
|`204 (No Content)`|	The search completed successfully, but returned no results.|
|`400 (Bad Request)`|	The was a problem with the request. For example, invalid Query Parameter syntax. The Response body contains details of the failure.|
|`401 (Unauthorized)`| The client isn't authenticated.|
|`403 (Forbidden)`              | The user isn't authorized. |
|`503 (Service Unavailable)`	| The service is unavailable or busy. Please try again later.|

#### Additional Notes

The query API will not return `413 (request entity too large)`. If the requested query response limit is outside of the acceptable range, a bad request will be returned. Anything requested within the acceptable range, will be resolved.

* Paged results are optimized to return matched newest instance first, this may result in duplicate records in subsequent pages if newer data matching the query was added.
* Matching is case insensitive and accent insensitive for PN VR types.
* Matching is case insensitive and accent sensitive for other string VR types.
* If there's a scenario where canceling a Workitem and querying the same happens at the same time, then the query will most likely exclude the Workitem that's getting updated and the response code will be `206 (Partial Content)`.
