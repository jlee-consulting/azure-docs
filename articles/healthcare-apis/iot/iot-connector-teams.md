# MedTech service and Microsoft Teams notifications

In this article, we'll explore using the MedTech service and Microsoft Teams for notifications.

## MedTech service and Teams notifications reference architecture

When combining MedTech service, a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) service, and Teams, you can enable multiple care solutions.

Below is the MedTech service to Teams notifications conceptual architecture for enabling the MedTech service, FHIR, and Teams Patient App.

You can even embed Power BI Dashboards inside the Microsoft Teams client. For more information on embedding Power BI in Microsoft Team visit [here](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-embed-report-microsoft-teams).

The MedTech service for can ingest IoT data from most IoT devices or gateways regardless of location, data center, or cloud.

We do encourage the use of Azure IoT services to assist with device/gateway connectivity.

For some solutions, Azure IoT Central can be used in place of Azure IoT Hub.

Azure IoT Edge can be used in with IoT Hub to create an on-premises end point for devices and/or in-device connectivity.
