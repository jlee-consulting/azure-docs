# Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) troubleshooting guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article provides steps for troubleshooting common Azure IoT Connector for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) error messages and conditions. You'll also learn how to create copies of the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) Conversion Mapping JSON templates such as Device and FHIR. Also, you can use the Conversion Mapping JSON templates for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal.  

> [!NOTE]
> In the remainder of this article, Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) will be referred as IoT Connector.

> [!TIP]
> If must open a [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the IoT Connector, ensure to include copies of your conversion mapping JSON to assist with the troubleshooting process.

## Device and FHIR Conversion Mapping JSON template validations

This section describes the validation process that the IoT Connector performs. The validation process validates the Device and FHIR Conversion Mapping JSON templates before allowing them to be saved for use. These elements are required in the Device and FHIR Conversion Mapping JSON.

**Device Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:-------|:------|
|TypeName|True|
|TypeMatchExpression|True|
|DeviceIdExpression|True|
|TimestampExpression|True|
|Values[].ValueName|True|
|Values[].ValueExpression|True|

> [!NOTE]
> `Values[].ValueName and Values[].ValueExpression` elements are only required if you have a value entry in the array. It's valid to have no values mapped. This is used when the telemetry being sent is an event. 
>
>For example:
> 
>When a wearable IoMT device is put on or removed, the element(s) don't have any values except for a name that the IoT Connector matches and emits. On the FHIR conversion, the IoT Connector maps it to a code-able concept based on the semantic type. This means that no actual values are populated.

**FHIR Mapping**

|Element|Required|
|:------|:-------|
|TypeName|True|

> [!NOTE]
> This is the only required FHIR Mapping element validated at this time.

## Why is my Azure IoT Connector for FHIR (preview) data not showing up in FHIR service?

|Potential issues|Fixes|
|----------------|-----|
|Data is still being processed.|Data is egressed to the FHIR service in batches (every ~15 minutes).  Itâ€™s possible the data is still being processed and extra time is needed for the data to be persisted in the FHIR service.|
|Device conversion-mapping JSON hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming device conversion-mapping JSON.|
|FHIR conversion-mapping JSON hasn't been configured.|Configure and save conforming FHIR conversion-mapping JSON.|
|The device message doesn't contain an expected expression defined in the device mapping.|Verify `JsonPath` expressions defined in the device mapping match tokens defined in the device message.|
|A Device Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Device Resource in the FHIR service. Ensure the Device Resource contains an identifier that matches the device identifier provided in the incoming message.|
|A Patient Resource hasn't been created in the FHIR service (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Create a valid Patient Resource in the FHIR service.|
|The `Device.patient` reference isn't set, or the reference is invalid (Resolution Type: Lookup only)*.|Make sure the Device Resource contains a valid [Reference](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.patient) to a Patient Resource.|

### The operation performed by the IoT Connector

This property represents the operation being performed by the IoT Connector when the error has occurred. An operation generally represents the data flow stage while processing a device message. Below is a list of possible values for this property.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about the different stages of data flow in the IoT Connector, see [IoT Connector for FHIR: data flow](iot-data-flow.md).

|Data flow stage|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Setup|The setup data flow stage is the operation specific to setting up your instance of the IoT Connector.|
|Normalization|Normalization is the data flow stage where the device data gets normalized.|
|Grouping|The grouping data flow stage where the normalized data gets grouped.|
|FHIRConversion|FHIRConversion is the data flow stage where the grouped-normalized data is transformed into a FHIR resource.|
|Unknown|Unknown is the operation type that's unknown when an error occurs.|

### The severity of the error

This property represents the severity of the occurred error. Below is a list of possible values for this property.

|Severity|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Warning|Some minor issue exists in the data flow process, but processing of the device message doesn't stop.|
|Error|This message occurs when the processing of a specific device message has run into an error and other messages may continue to execute as expected.|
|Critical|This error is when some system level issue exists with the IoT Connector, and no messages are expected to process.|

### The type of the error

This property signifies a category for a given error, which it basically represents a logical grouping for similar types of errors. Below is a list of possible values for this property.

|Error type|Description|
|----------|-----------|

|`FHIRResourceError`|This error type is related to existing resources in the FHIR server that are referenced by the IoT Connector.|
|`FHIRServerError`|This error type occurs when communicating with the FHIR server.|
|`GeneralError`|This error type is about all other types of errors.|

### The name of the error

This property provides the name for a specific error. Below is the list of all error names with their description and associated error type(s), severity, and data flow stage(s).

|Error name|Description|Error type(s)|Error severity|Data flow stage(s)|

## Creating copies of the IoT Connector conversion mapping JSON

Copying the IoT Connector mapping files can be useful for editing and archiving outside of the Azure portal website.

The mapping file copies should be provided to Azure Technical Support when opening a support ticket to help with the troubleshooting process.

> [!NOTE]
> JSON is the only supported format for Device and FHIR mapping files at this time.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR [Device and FHIR conversion mapping JSON](how-to-use-fhir-mapping-iot.md)

1. Select the **"IoT Connector (preview)"** blade on the left side of the Azure Healthcare APIs Workspace.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png" alt-text="Select IoT Connector blade." lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/iot-connector-blade.png":::

2. Select the name of **IoT Connector** that you'll be copying the conversion mapping JSON from.

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-connector-with-box.png" alt-text="IoT Connector2" lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-connector-with-box.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> This process may also be used for copying and saving the contents of the **"Configure FHIR mapping"** JSON.

3. Select the contents of the JSON and do a copy operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + C**). 

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-device-json-with-box.png" alt-text="IoT Connector4" lightbox="media/iot-troubleshoot/map-files-select-device-json-with-box.png":::

4. Do a paste operation (for example: Press **Ctrl + V**) into a new file within an editor like Microsoft Visual Studio Code or Notepad. Ensure to save the file with the extension **.json**.

> [!TIP]
> If you'll be opening a [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for the Azure IoT Connector for FHIR, make sure to include copies of your conversion mapping JSON to help with the troubleshooting process.
