Azure Health Data Services is a set of managed API services based on open standards and frameworks for the healthcare industry. They enable you to build scalable and secure healthcare solutions by bringing protected health information (PHI) datasets together and connecting them end-to-end with tools for machine learning, analytics, and AI. This document provides details about the features and enhancements made to Azure Health Data Services including the different service types (FHIR service, DICOM service, and MedTech service) that seamlessly work with one another.

## June 2022

### FHIR service

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Export Job not being queued for execution.  |Fixes issue with export job not being queued due to duplicate job definition caused due to reference to container URL. For more information, see [#2648](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2648). |
|Queries not providing consistent result count after appended with the _sort operator.   |Fixes the issue with the help of distinct operator to resolve inconsistency and record duplication in response.  For more information, see [#2680](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2680). |


## May 2022

### FHIR service

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Removes SQL retry on upsert  |Removes retry on SQL command for upsert. The error still occurs, but data is saved correctly in success cases. For more information, see [#2571](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2571). |
|Added handling for SqlTruncate errors  |Added a check for SqlTruncate exceptions and tests. In particular, this will catch SqlTruncate exceptions for Decimal type based on the specified precision and scale. For more information, see [#2553](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2553). |

### DICOM service

#### **Features**

|Enhancements | Related information |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
|DICOM service supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)  |DICOM service now supports [CORS](./../healthcare-apis/dicom/configure-cross-origin-resource-sharing.md). CORS allows you to configure settings so that applications from one domain (origin) can access resources from a different domain, known as a cross-domain request. |
|DICOMcast supports Private Link   |DICOMcast has been updated to support Azure Health Data Services workspaces that have been configured to use [Private Link](./../healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-configure-private-link.md). |
|UPS-RS supports Change and Retrieve work item  |Modality worklist (UPS-RS) endpoints have been added to support Change and Retrieve operations for work items. |
|API version is now required as part of the URI  |All REST API requests to the DICOM service must now include the API version in the URI.  For more details, see [API versioning for DICOM service](./../healthcare-apis/dicom/api-versioning-dicom-service.md). |

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Index the first value for DICOM tags that incorrectly specify multiple values |Attributes that are defined to have a single value but have specified multiple values will now be leniently accepted. The first value for such attributes will be indexed. |

## April 2022

### FHIR service

#### **Features and enhancements**

|Enhancements |Related information |
| :------------------- | :--------------- |
|FHIRPath Patch |FHIRPath Patch was added as a feature to both the Azure API for FHIR. This implements FHIRPath Patch as defined on the [HL7](http://hl7.org/fhir/fhirpatch.html) website. |
|Handles invalid header on versioned update |When the versioning policy is set to "versioned-update", we required that the most recent version of the resource is provided in the request's if-match header on an update. The specified version must be in ETag format. Previously, a 500 would be returned if the version was invalid or in an incorrect format. This update now returns a 400 Bad Request. For more information, see [PR #2467](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2467). |
|Bulk import in public preview |The bulk-import feature enables importing FHIR data to the FHIR server at high throughput using the $import operation. It's designed for initial data load into the FHIR server. For more information, see [Bulk-import FHIR data (Preview)](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/import-data.md). |

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Adds core to resource path |Part of the path to a string resource was accidentally removed in the versioning policy. This fix adds it back in. For more information, see [PR #2470](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2470). |

#### **Known issues**

For more information about the currently known issues with the FHIR service, see [Known issues: FHIR service](known-issues.md).

### DICOM service

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Reduce the strictness of validation applied to incoming DICOM files |When value representation (VR) is a decimal string (DS)/ integer string (IS), `fo-dicom` serialization treats value as a number. Customer DICOM files could be old and contains invalid numbers. Our service blocks such file upload due to the serialization exception. For more information, see [PR #1450](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1450). |
|Correctly parse a range of input in the content negotiation headers |Currently, WADO with Accept: multipart/related; type=application/dicom will throw an error. It will accept Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom", but they should be equivalent. For more information, see [PR #1462](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1462). |
|Fixed an issue where parallel upload of images in a study could fail under certain circumstances  |Handle race conditions during parallel instance inserts in the same study. For more information, see [PR #1491](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1491) and [PR #1496](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1496). |

#### **Bug fixes**

|Bug fixes |Related information |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------- |
|Fixed 500 error when `SearchParameter` Code is null |Fixed an issue with `SearchParameter` if it had a null value for Code, the result would be a 500. Now it will result in an  `InvalidResourceException` like the other values do. [#2343](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2343) |

For more information, see [Patient-everything in FHIR](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/patient-everything.md#processing-patient-links) documentation. |
|Added software name and version to capability statement. |In the capability statement, the software name now distinguishes if you're using Azure API for FHIR or Azure Health Data Services. The software version will now specify which open-source [release package](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/releases) is live in the managed service [#2294](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2294). Addresses: [#1778](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/1778) and [#2241](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/2241) |
|Compress continuation tokens |In certain instances, the continuation token was too long to be able to follow the [next link](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/overview-of-search.md#pagination) in searches and would result in a 404. To resolve this, we compressed the continuation token to ensure it stays below the size limit [#2279](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2279). Addresses issue [#2250](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/2250). |
