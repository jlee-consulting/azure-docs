# Bulk-import FHIR data (Preview)

The bulk-import feature enables importing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) data to the FHIR server at high throughput using the $import operation. This feature is suitable for initial data load into the FHIR server.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have the **FHIR Data Importer** role on the FHIR server to use $import.

## Current limitations

* Conditional references in resources aren't supported.
* If multiple resources share the same resource ID, then only one of those resources will be imported at random and an error will be logged corresponding to the remaining resources sharing the ID.
* The data to be imported must be in the same Tenant as that of the FHIR service.
* Maximum number of files to be imported per operation is 1,000.

## Using $import operation

To use $import, you'll need to configure the FHIR server using the instructions in the [Configure bulk-import settings](configure-import-data.md) article and set the **initialImportMode** to *true*. Doing so also suspends write operations (POST and PUT) on the FHIR server. You should set the **initialImportMode** to *false* to reenable write operations after you have finished importing your data.

The FHIR data to be imported must be stored in resource specific files in FHIR NDJSON format on the Azure blob store. All the resources in a file must be of the same type. You may have multiple files per resource type.

### Calling $import

Make a ```POST``` call to ```<<FHIR service base URL>>/$import``` with the following required headers and body, which contains a FHIR [Parameters](http://hl7.org/fhir/parameters.html) resource.

An empty response body with a **callback** link will be returned in the `Content-location` header of the response together with ```202-Accepted``` status code. You can use this callback link to check the import status.

#### Request Header

```http
Prefer:respond-async
Content-Type:application/fhir+json
```

#### Body

| Parameter Name      | Description | Card. |  Accepted values |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| inputFormat      | String representing the name of the data source format. Currently only FHIR NDJSON files are supported. | 1..1 | ```application/fhir+ndjson``` |
| mode      | Import mode. Currently only initial load mode is supported. | 1..1 | ```InitialLoad``` |
| input   | Details of the input files. | 1..* | A JSON array with three parts described in the table below. |

| Input part name   | Description | Card. |  Accepted values |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| type   |  Resource type of input file   | 1..1 |  A valid [FHIR resource type](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) that match the input file. |
|URL   |  Azure storage url of input file   | 1..1 | URL value of the input file that can't be modified. |
| etag   |  Etag of the input file on Azure storage used to verify the file content hasn't changed. | 0..1 |  Etag value of the input file that can't be modified. |

**Sample body:**

```json
{
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [
        {
            "name": "inputFormat",
            "valueString": "application/fhir+ndjson"
        },
        {
            "name": "mode",
            "valueString": "InitialLoad"
        },
        {
            "name": "input",
            "part": [
                {
                    "name": "type",
                    "valueString": "Patient"
                },
                {
                    "name": "url",
                    "valueUri": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/resources/Patient.ndjson"
                },
                {
                    "name": "etag",
                    "valueUri": "0x8D92A7342657F4F"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "input",
            "part": [
                {
                    "name": "type",
                    "valueString": "CarePlan"
                },
                {
                    "name": "url",
                    "valueUri": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/resources/CarePlan.ndjson"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Checking import status

Make the REST call with the ```GET``` method to the **callback** link returned in the previous step. You can interpret the response using the following table:

| Response code      | Response body |Description |
| ----------- | -----------  |-----------  |
| 202 Accepted | |The operation is still running.|
| 200 OK |The response body doesn't contain any error.url entry|All resources were imported successfully.|
| 200 OK |The response body contains some error.url entry|Error occurred while importing some of the resources. See the files located at error.url for the details. Rest of the resources were imported successfully.|
| Other||A fatal error occurred and the operation has stopped. Successfully imported resources haven't been rolled back.|

Below are some of the important fields in the response body:

| Field | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|transactionTime|Start time of the bulk-import operation.|
|output.count|Count of resources that were successfully imported|
|error.count|Count of resources that weren't imported due to some error|
|error.url|URL of the file containing details of the error. Each error.url is unique to an input URL. |

**Sample response:**

```json
{
    "transactionTime": "2021-07-16T06:46:52.3873388+00:00",
    "request": "https://importperf.azurewebsites.net/$Import",
    "output": [
        {
            "type": "Patient",
            "count": 10000,
            "inputUrl": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/resources/Patient.ndjson"
        },
        {
            "type": "CarePlan",
            "count": 199949,
            "inputUrl": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/resources/CarePlan.ndjson"
        }
    ],
    "error": [
        { 
        "type": "OperationOutcome",
        "count": 51,
        "inputUrl": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/resources/CarePlan.ndjson",
        "url": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/fhirlogs/CarePlan06b88c6933a34c7c83cb18b7dd6ae3d8.ndjson"
        }
    ]
}
```
## Troubleshooting

Below are some error codes you may encounter and the solutions to help you resolve them.

### 200 OK, but there's an error with the URL in the response

**Behavior:** Import operation succeeds and returns ```200 OK```. However, `error.url` are present in the response body. Files present at the `error.url` location contain JSON fragments like in the example below:

```json
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "error",
            "details": {
                "text": "Given conditional reference '{0}' does not resolve to a resource."
            },
            "diagnostics": "Failed to process resource at line: {1}"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Cause:** NDJSON files contain resources with conditional references, which are currently not supported by $import.

**Solution:** Replace the conditional references to normal references in the NDJSON files.

### 400 Bad Request

**Behavior:** Import operation failed and ```400 Bad Request``` is returned. Response body has the following content:

```json
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "id": "13876ec9-3170-4525-87ec-9e165052d70d",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "error",
            "code": "processing",
            "diagnostics": "import operation failed for reason: No such host is known. (example.blob.core.windows.net:443)"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Solution:** Verify the link to the Azure storage is correct. Check the network and firewall settings to make sure that the FHIR server is able to access the storage. If your service is in a VNet, ensure that the storage is in the same VNet or in a VNet that has peering with the FHIR service VNet.

### 403 Forbidden

**Behavior:** Import operation failed and ```403 Forbidden``` is returned. The response body has the following content:

```json
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "id": "bd545acc-af5d-42d5-82c3-280459125033",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "error",
            "code": "processing",
            "diagnostics": "import operation failed for reason: Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Cause:** We use managed identity for source storage auth. This error may be caused by a missing or wrong role assignment.

**Solution:** Assign _Storage Blob Data Contributor_ role to the FHIR server following [the RBAC guide.](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md?tabs=current)

### 500 Internal Server Error

**Behavior:** Import operation failed and ```500 Internal Server Error``` is returned. Response body has the following content:

```json
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "id": "0d0f007d-9e8e-444e-89ed-7458377d7889",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "error",
            "code": "processing",
            "diagnostics": "import operation failed for reason: The database '****' has reached its size quota. Partition or delete data, drop indexes, or consult the documentation for possible resolutions."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Cause:** You've reached the storage limit of the FHIR service.

**Solution:** Reduce the size of your data or consider Azure API for FHIR, which has a higher storage limit.

## Bulk import - another option

As illustrated in this article, $import is one way of doing bulk import. Another way is using an open-source solution, called [FHIR Bulk Loader](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader). FHIR-Bulk Loader is an Azure Function App solution that provides the following capabilities for ingesting FHIR data:

* Imports FHIR Bundles (compressed and non-compressed) and NDJSON files into a FHIR service
* High Speed Parallel Event Grid that triggers from storage accounts or other event grid resources
* Complete Auditing, Error logging and Retry for throttled transactions
