# Create a site using the Azure portal

Azure Private 5G Core Preview private mobile networks include one or more *sites*. Each site represents a physical enterprise location (for example, Contoso Corporation's Chicago factory) containing an Azure Stack Edge device that hosts a packet core instance. In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to create a site in your private mobile network using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- Carry out the steps in [Complete the prerequisite tasks for deploying a private mobile network](complete-private-mobile-network-prerequisites.md) for your new site.
- Collect all of the information in [Collect the required information for a site](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md).
- Ensure you can sign in to the Azure portal using an account with access to the active subscription you used to create your private mobile network. This account must have the built-in Contributor or Owner role at the subscription scope.

## Create the mobile network site resource

In this step, you'll create the mobile network site resource representing the physical enterprise location of your Azure Stack Edge device, which will host the packet core instance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for and select the **Mobile Network** resource representing the private mobile network to which you want to add a site.

1. On the **Get started** tab, select **Create sites**.

1. Use the information you collected in [Collect site resource values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-mobile-network-site-resource-values) to fill out the fields on the **Basics** configuration tab, and then select **Next : Packet core >**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-site/create-site-basics-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Basics configuration tab for a site resource.":::

1. You'll now see the **Packet core** configuration tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-site/create-site-packet-core-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Packet core configuration tab for a site resource.":::

1. In the **Packet core** section, set the fields as follows:

    - Use the information you collected in [Collect packet core configuration values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-packet-core-configuration-values) to fill out the **Technology type**, **Azure Stack Edge device**, and **Custom location** fields.
    - Select the recommended packet core version in the **Version** field.
    - Ensure **AKS-HCI** is selected in the **Platform** field.

1. Use the information you collected in [Collect access network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-access-network-values) to fill out the fields in the **Access network** section. Note:

    - **ASE N2 virtual subnet** and **ASE N3 virtual subnet** (if this site will support 5G UEs) or **ASE S1-MME virtual subnet** and **ASE S1-U virtual subnet** (if this site will support 4G UEs) must match the corresponding virtual network names on port 5 on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.

1. In the **Attached data networks** section, select **Add data network**. Use the information you collected in [Collect data network values](collect-required-information-for-a-site.md#collect-data-network-values) to fill out the fields. Note:
    - **ASE N6 virtual subnet** (if this site will support 5G UEs) or **ASE SGi virtual subnet** (if this site will support 4G UEs) must match the corresponding virtual network name on port 6 on your Azure Stack Edge Pro device.
    - If you decided not to configure a DNS server, clear the **Specify DNS addresses for UEs?** checkbox.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-site/create-site-add-data-network.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Add data network screen.":::

1. Select **Submit**. Note that you can only connect the packet core instance to a single data network.
1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Azure will now validate the configuration values you've entered. You should see a message indicating that your values have passed validation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-site/create-site-validation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing successful validation of configuration values for a site resource.":::

    If the validation fails, you'll see an error message and the **Configuration** tab(s) containing the invalid configuration will be flagged with red dots. Select the flagged tab(s) and use the error messages to correct invalid configuration before returning to the **Review + create** tab.

2. Once your configuration has been validated, you can select **Create** to create the site. The Azure portal will display the following confirmation screen when the site has been created.

3. Select **Go to resource group**, and confirm that it contains the following new resources:

    - A **Mobile Network Site** resource representing the site as a whole.
    - A **Packet Core Control Plane** resource representing the control plane function of the packet core instance in the site.
    - A **Packet Core Data Plane** resource representing the data plane function of the packet core instance in the site.
    - An **Attached Data Network** resource representing the site's view of the data network.

## Next steps

If you haven't already done so, you should now design the policy control configuration for your private mobile network. This allows you to customize how your packet core instances apply quality of service (QoS) characteristics to traffic. You can also block or limit certain flows.
