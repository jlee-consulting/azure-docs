## Fixed issues
* Security enhancements
    * Improvements on using Tags for clusters in line with the [SFI](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative) requirements.
    * Improvements in probes scripts as per the [SFI](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/resources/secure-future-initiative) requirements.
* Improvements in the HDInsight Log Analytics with System Managed Identity support for HDInsight Resource Provider.
* Addition of new activity to upgrade the `mdsd` agent version for old image (created before 2024).
* Enabling MISE in gateway as part of the continued improvements for [MSAL Migration](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview).
* Incorporate Spark Thrift Server `Httpheader hiveConf` to the Jetty HTTP ConnectionFactory.
* Revert RANGER-3753 and RANGER-3593.
    
    The `setOwnerUser` implementation given in Ranger 2.3.0 release has a critical regression issue when being used by Hive. In Ranger 2.3.0, when HiveServer2 tries to evaluate the policies, Ranger Client tries to get the owner of the hive table by calling the Metastore in the setOwnerUser function which essentially makes call to storage to check access for that table. This issue causes the queries to run slow when Hive runs on 2.3.0 Ranger.
