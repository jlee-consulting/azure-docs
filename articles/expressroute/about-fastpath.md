# About ExpressRoute FastPath

ExpressRoute virtual network gateway is designed to exchange network routes and route network traffic. FastPath is designed to improve the data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network. When enabled, FastPath sends network traffic directly to virtual machines in the virtual network, bypassing the gateway.

## Requirements

### Circuits

FastPath is available on all ExpressRoute circuits. Support for virtual network peering and UDR over FastPath is now generally available and only for connections associated to ExpressRoute Direct circuits. Limited general availability (GA) support for Private Endpoint/Private Link connectivity is only available for connections associated to ExpressRoute Direct circuits. 

### Gateways

FastPath still requires a virtual network gateway to be created to exchange routes between a virtual network and an on-premises network. For more information about virtual network gateways and ExpressRoute, including performance information, and gateway SKUs, see [ExpressRoute virtual network gateways](expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways.md).

To configure FastPath, the virtual network gateway must be either:

* Ultra Performance
* ErGw3AZ

### Virtual network peering

For the FastPath feature to function correctly, the hub virtual network and any peered spoke virtual networks must reside within the same region. It is important to note that FastPath doesn't support globally peered virtual networks.

## Limitations

While FastPath supports most configurations, it doesn't support the following features:

* Basic Load Balancer: If you deploy a Basic internal load balancer in your virtual network or the Azure PaaS service you deploy in your virtual network uses a Basic internal load balancer, the network traffic from your on-premises network to the virtual IPs hosted on the Basic load balancer is sent to the virtual network gateway. The solution is to upgrade the Basic load balancer to a [Standard load balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md).

* Private Link: FastPath Connectivity to a private endpoint or Private Link service over an ExpressRoute Direct circuit is supported for limited scenarios. For more information, see [enable FastPath and Private Link for 100-Gbps ExpressRoute Direct](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md#fastpath-virtual-network-peering-user-defined-routes-udrs-and-private-link-support-for-expressroute-direct-connections). FastPath connectivity to a Private endpoint/Private Link service isn't supported for ExpressRoute partner circuits.

* DNS Private Resolver: Azure ExpressRoute FastPath doesn't support connectivity to [DNS Private Resolver](../dns/dns-private-resolver-overview.md).

### IP address limits

| ExpressRoute SKU | Bandwidth | FastPath IP limit |
|--|--|--|
| ExpressRoute Direct Port | 100 Gbps | 200,000 |
| ExpressRoute Direct Port | 10 Gbps | 100,000 |
| ExpressRoute provider circuit | 10 Gbps and lower | 25,000 |

> [!NOTE]
> * ExpressRoute Direct has a cumulative limit at the port level.
> * Traffic flows through the ExpressRoute gateway when these IP limits are reached.
> * You can configure alerts through Azure Monitor to notify when the [number of FastPath routes](expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts.md#fastpath-routes-count-at-circuit-level) are nearing the threshold limit.

## Limited General Availability (GA)

FastPath support for Private Endpoint/Private Link connectivity is available for limited scenarios for 100/10Gbps ExpressRoute Direct connections. Virtual Network Peering and UDR support are available globally across all Azure regions. Private Endpoint/ Private Link connectivity is available in the following Azure regions:
- Australia East
- East Asia
- East US
- East US 2
- North Central US
- North Europe
- South Central US
- South East Asia
- UK South
- West Central US
- West Europe
- West US
- West US 2
- West US 3

FastPath Private endpoint/Private Link connectivity is supported for the following Azure Services:
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage
- Third Party Private Link Services

> [!NOTE]
> * Enabling FastPath Private endpoint/Link support for limited GA scenarios may take upwards of 4 weeks to complete. Please plan your deployment(s) in advance.
> * Connections associated to ExpressRoute partner circuits aren't eligible for this preview. Both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity is supported.
> * FastPath connectivity to a Private endpoint/Link service deployed to a spoke Virtual Network, peered to the Hub Virtual Network (where the ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway is deployed), is supported. 
> * Private Link pricing will not apply to traffic sent over ExpressRoute FastPath. For more information about pricing, check out the [Private Link pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).
> * FastPath supports a max of 100Gbps connectivity to a single Availability Zone (Az).

## Next steps

- To enable FastPath, see configure ExpressRoute FastPath using the [Azure portal](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager.md#configure-expressroute-fastpath) or using [Azure PowerShell](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md#configure-expressroute-fastpath).
