### Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the Azure portal with this [Preview link](https://aka.ms/expressrouteguidedportal). This link is required to access the new preview create experience for an ExpressRoute circuit.

### Create a new ExpressRoute circuit (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your ExpressRoute circuit is billed from the moment a service key is issued. Ensure that you perform this operation when the connectivity provider is ready to provision the circuit.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **+ Create a resource**. Search for **ExpressRoute (preview)** and then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/create-expressroute-circuit-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of preview create experience of ExpressRoute circuit resource.":::

1. Select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** for the circuit. Then select the type of **Resiliency** for your setup.

    **Maximum Resiliency (Recommended)** - This option provides the highest level of resiliency for your ExpressRoute connectivity. It provides two ExpressRoute circuits with local redundancy in two different ExpressRoute locations.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Maximum Resiliency provides maximum protection against location wide outages and connectivity failures in an ExpressRoute location. This option is strongly recommended for all critical and production workloads.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/maximum-resiliency.png" alt-text="Diagram of maximum resiliency for an ExpressRoute connection.":::

    **Standard Resiliency** - This option provides a single ExpressRoute circuit with local redundancy at a single ExpressRoute location.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Standard Resiliency does not provide protection against location wide outages. This option is suitable for non-critical and non-production workloads.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/standard-resiliency.png" alt-text="Diagram of standard resiliency for an ExpressRoute connection.":::

1. Enter or select the following information for the respective resiliency type.

### View the circuits and properties

**View all the circuits**

You can view all the circuits that you created by searching for **ExpressRoute circuits** in the search box at the top of the portal.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ExpressRoute circuit menu.":::

All Expressroute circuits created in the subscription appear here.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ExpressRoute circuit list.":::

**View the properties**

You can view the properties of the circuit by selecting it. On the Overview page for your circuit, you find the **Service Key**. Provide the service key to the service provider to complete the provisioning process. The service key is unique to your circuit.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ExpressRoute properties.":::

### Send the service key to your connectivity provider for provisioning

On this page, **Provider status** gives you the current state of provisioning on the service-provider side. **Circuit status** provides you with the state on the Microsoft side. For more information about circuit provisioning states, see the [Workflows](expressroute-workflows.md#expressroute-circuit-provisioning-states) article.

When you create a new ExpressRoute circuit, the circuit is in the following state:

Provider status: **Not provisioned**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-overview-provisioning-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot of provisioning process.":::

The circuit changes to the following state when the connectivity provider is currently enabling it for you:

Provider status: **Provisioning**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

To use the ExpressRoute circuit, it must be in the following state:

Provider status: **Provisioned**<BR>
Circuit status: **Enabled**

### Periodically check the status and the state of the circuit key

You can view the properties of the circuit that you're interested in by selecting it. Check the **Provider status** and ensure that it has moved to **Provisioned** before you continue.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/provisioned.png" alt-text="Screenshot of circuit and provider status.":::

### Create your routing configuration

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the [ExpressRoute circuit routing configuration](expressroute-howto-routing-portal-resource-manager.md) article to create and modify circuit peerings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions only apply to circuits that are created with service providers that offer layer 2 connectivity services. If you're using a service provider that offers managed layer 3 services (typically an IP VPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider configures and manages routing for you.

### Link a virtual network to an ExpressRoute circuit

Next, link a virtual network to your ExpressRoute circuit. Use the [Linking virtual networks to ExpressRoute circuits](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md) article when you work with the Resource Manager deployment model.

## <a name="status"></a>Getting the status of an ExpressRoute circuit

You can view the status of a circuit by selecting it and viewing the Overview page.

## <a name="modify"></a>Modifying an ExpressRoute circuit

You can modify certain properties of an ExpressRoute circuit without impacting connectivity. You can modify the bandwidth, SKU, billing model and allow classic operations on the **Configuration** page. For information on limits and limitations, see the [ExpressRoute FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md).

You can do the following tasks with no downtime:

* Enable or disable an ExpressRoute Premium add-on for your ExpressRoute circuit.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Changing the SKU from **Standard/Premium** to **Local** is not supported in Azure portal. To downgrade the SKU to **Local**, you can use [Azure PowerShell](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) or [Azure CLI](howto-circuit-cli.md).

* Increase the bandwidth of your ExpressRoute circuit, provided there's capacity available on the port.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > * Downgrading the bandwidth of a circuit is not supported.
  > * To determine if there is available capacity for a bandwidth upgrade, submit a support request.

* Change the metering plan from *Metered Data* to *Unlimited Data*.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Changing the metering plan from **Unlimited Data** to **Metered Data** is not supported.

* You can enable and disable *Allow Classic Operations*.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You may have to recreate the ExpressRoute circuit if there is inadequate capacity on the existing port. You cannot upgrade the circuit if there is no additional capacity available at that location.
  >
  > Although you can seamlessly upgrade the bandwidth, you cannot reduce the bandwidth of an ExpressRoute circuit without disruption. Downgrading bandwidth requires you to deprovision the ExpressRoute circuit and then reprovision a new ExpressRoute circuit.
  >
  > Disabling the Premium add-on operation can fail if you're using resources that are greater than what is permitted for the standard circuit.

To modify an ExpressRoute circuit, select **Configuration**.

## <a name="delete"></a>Deprovisioning and deleting an ExpressRoute circuit 

1. On the Azure portal menu, navigate to the ExpressRoute circuit you wish to deprovision.

1. In the **Overview** page, select **Delete**. If there are any associated resources attached to the circuit, you're asked to view the resources. Select **Yes** to see the associations that need to be removed before starting the deprovisioning process. If there are no associated resources, you can proceed with step 4.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-circuit-deprovision.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deprovisioning circuit for ExpressRoute.":::

1. In the **View Associated Resources of Circuit** pane, you can see the resources associated with the circuit. Ensure you delete the resources before proceeding with the deprovisioning of the circuit. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-deprovision-associated-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deleting associated resources to ExpressRoute circuit.":::

1. After deleting all associated resources, work with your circuit service provider to deprovision the circuit on their end. The circuit is required to be deprovisioned before it can be deleted. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-deprovision-after-deletion.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deprovisioning the ExpressRoute circuit.":::

1. After your circuit service provider has confirmed that they've deprovisioned the circuit, confirm that the *Provider status* changes to **Not provisioned** in the Azure portal. Once the *Provider status* is **Not provisioned**, you'll be able to delete the circuit.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager/expressroute-deprovisioned.png" alt-text="Screenshot of deprovisioned circuit.":::


> [!NOTE]
>* You must delete all associated [Virtual Network connections](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager.md#clean-up-resources), [Authorizations](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-portal-resource-manager.md#circuit-owner-operations), and [Global Reach](expressroute-howto-set-global-reach-portal.md#disable-connectivity) from the ExpressRoute circuit before deprovisioning. If deprovisioning fails, check whether any associated resources are still linked to the circuit.
>* If the circuit service provider has deprovisioned the circuit (The *Provider status* has updated to **Not provisioned**), you can delete the circuit. This stops billing for the circuit.
