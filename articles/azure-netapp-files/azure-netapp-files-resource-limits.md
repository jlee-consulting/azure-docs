## Determine if a directory is approaching the limit size <a name="directory-limit"></a>  

You can use the `stat` command from a client to see whether a directory is approaching the maximum size limit for directory metadata (320 MB). If you reach the maximum size limit for a single directory for Azure NetApp Files, the error `No space left on device` occurs.   

For a 320-MB directory, the number of blocks is 655,360, with each block size being 512 bytes.  (That is, 320x1024x1024/512.)  This number translates to approximately 4 million files maximum for a 320-MB directory. However, the actual number of maximum files might be lower, depending on factors such as the number of files with non-ASCII characters in the directory. As such, you should use the `stat` command as follows to determine whether your directory is approaching its limit.  

Examples:

```console
[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat bin
File: 'bin'
Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 65536  directory

[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat tmp
File: 'tmp'
Size: 12288           Blocks: 24         IO Block: 65536  directory
 
[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat tmp1
File: 'tmp1'
Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 65536  directory
```

## `Maxfiles` limits <a name="maxfiles"></a> 

Azure NetApp Files volumes have a value called `maxfiles` that refers to the maximum number of files and folders (also known as inodes) a volume can contain. When the `maxfiles` limit is reached, clients receive "out of space" messages when attempting to create new files or folders. If you experience this issue, contact Microsoft technical support.

The `maxfiles` limit for an Azure NetApp Files volume is based on the size (quota) of the volume, where the service dynamically adjusts the `maxfiles` limit for a volume based on its provisioned size and uses the following guidelines.

- For regular volumes less than or equal to 683 GiB, the default `maxfiles` limit is 21,251,126.
- For regular volumes greater than 683 GiB, the default `maxfiles` limit is approximately one file (or inode) per 32 KiB of allocated volume capacity up to a maximum of 2,147,483,632.
- For [large volumes](large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md), the default `maxfiles` limit is approximately one file (or inode) per 32 KiB of allocated volume capacity up to a default maximum of 15,938,355,048.
- Each inode uses roughly 288 bytes of capacity in the volume. Having many inodes in a volume can consume a non-trivial amount of physical space overhead on top of the capacity of the actual data.
    - If a file is less than 64 bytes in size, it's stored in the inode itself and doesn't use additional capacity. This capacity is only used when files are actually allocated to the volume.
    - Files larger than 64 bytes do consume additional capacity on the volume. For instance, if there are one million files greater than 64 bytes in an Azure NetApp Files volume, then approximately 274 MiB of capacity would belong to the inodes.


The following table shows examples of the relationship `maxfiles` values based on volume sizes for regular volumes. 

| Volume size | Estimated maxfiles limit |
| - | - |
| 0 – 683 GiB | 21,251,126 |
| 1 TiB (1,073,741,824 KiB) | 31,876,709 |
| 10 TiB (10,737,418,240 KiB) | 318,767,099 |
| 50 TiB (53,687,091,200 KiB)	| 1,593,835,519 |
| 100 TiB (107,374,182,400 KiB) | 2,147,483,632 |

The following table shows examples of the relationship `maxfiles` values based on volume sizes for large volumes. 

| Volume size | Estimated maxfiles limit |
| - | - |
| 50 TiB (53,687,091,200 KiB) |	1,593,835,512 |
| 100 TiB (107,374,182,400 KiB)	| 3,187,671,024 |
| 200 TiB (214,748,364,800 KiB)	| 6,375,342,024  |
| 500 TiB (536,870,912,000 KiB)	| 15,938,355,048 |

To see the `maxfiles` allocation for a specific volume size, check the **Maximum number of files** field in the volume’s overview pane.

You can't set `maxfiles` limits for data protection volumes via a quota request. Azure NetApp Files automatically increases the `maxfiles` limit of a data protection volume to accommodate the number of files replicated to the volume. When a failover happens on a data protection volume, the `maxfiles` limit remains the last value before the failover. In this situation, you can submit a `maxfiles` [quota request](#request-limit-increase) for the volume.

## Request limit increase

You can create an Azure support request to increase the adjustable limits from the [Resource Limits](#resource-limits) table. 

>[!NOTE]
> Depending on available resources in the region and the limit increase requested, Azure support may require additional information in order to determine the feasibility of the request.

1. Go to **New Support Request** under **Support + troubleshooting**.   

2. Under the **Problem description** tab, provide the required information:
    1. For **Issue Type**, select **Service and Subscription Limits (Quotas)**.
    2. For **Subscription**, select your subscription. 
    3. For **Quota Type**, select **Storage: Azure NetApp Files limits**.  

    ![Screenshot that shows the Problem Description tab.](./media/shared/support-problem-descriptions.png)

3. Under the **Additional details** tab, select **Enter details** in the Request Details field.  

    ![Screenshot that shows the Details tab and the Enter Details field.](./media/shared/quota-additional-details.png)

4. To request limit increase, provide the following information in the Quota Details window that appears:
    1. In **Quota Type**, select the type of resource you want to increase.  
        For example:   
        * *Regional Capacity Quota per Subscription (TiB)*
        * *Number of NetApp accounts per Azure region per subscription*
        * *Number of volumes per subscription*

    2. In **Region Requested**, select your region.   
        The current and default sizes are displayed under Quota State.
    
    3. Enter a value to request an increase for the quota type you specified.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows how to display and request increase for regional quota.](./media/azure-netapp-files-resource-limits/quota-details-regional-request.png)

5. Select **Save and continue**. Select **Review + create** to create the request.
