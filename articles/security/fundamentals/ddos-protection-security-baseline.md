### 3.2: Change default passwords where applicable

**Guidance**: Azure AD does not have the concept of default passwords. Other Azure resources requiring a password forces a password to be created with complexity requirements and a minimum password length, which differs depending on the service. You are responsible for third-party applications and marketplace services that may use default passwords.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.3: Use dedicated administrative accounts

**Guidance**: Create standard operating procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management to monitor the number of administrative accounts.

Additionally, to help you keep track of dedicated administrative accounts, you may use recommendations from Azure Security Center or built-in Azure Policies, such as:
- There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription
- Deprecated accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription
- External accounts with owner permissions should be removed from your subscription

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 3.11: Monitor attempts to access deactivated credentials

**Guidance**: Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system where applicable. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.

You have access to Azure AD sign-in activity, audit and risk event log sources, which allow you to integrate with Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

You can streamline this process by creating diagnostic settings for Azure AD user accounts and sending the audit logs and sign-in logs to a Log Analytics workspace. You can configure desired log alerts within Log Analytics.

### 8.2: Pre-scan files to be uploaded to non-compute Azure resources

**Guidance**: Microsoft Anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services (for example, Azure DDoS Protection), however it does not run on customer content.

It is your responsibility to pre-scan any content being uploaded to non-compute Azure resources. Microsoft cannot access customer data, and therefore cannot conduct anti-malware scans of customer content on your behalf.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 8.3: Ensure anti-malware software and signatures are updated

**Guidance**: Not applicable; this recommendation is intended for compute resources. Microsoft Anti-malware is enabled on the underlying host that supports Azure services, however it does not run on customer content.

## Incident response

*For more information, see [Security control: Incident response](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response).*

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

* [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

* [Use tags to organize your Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.3: Test security response procedures

**Guidance**: Conduct exercises to test your systemsâ€™ incident response capabilities on a regular cadence to help protect your Azure resources. Identify weak points and gaps and revise plan as needed.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.4: Provide security incident contact details and configure alert notifications for security incidents

**Guidance**: Security incident contact information will be used by Microsoft to contact you if the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) discovers that your data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. Review incidents after the fact to ensure that issues are resolved.

* [How to set the Azure Security Center Security Contact](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.5: Incorporate security alerts into your incident response system

**Guidance**: Export your Azure Security Center alerts and recommendations using the Continuous Export feature to help identify risks to Azure resources. Continuous Export allows you to export alerts and recommendations either manually or in an ongoing, continuous fashion. You may use the Azure Security Center data connector to stream the alerts to Azure Sentinel.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 10.6: Automate the response to security alerts

**Guidance**: Use the Workflow Automation feature in Azure Security Center to automatically trigger responses via "Logic Apps" on security alerts and recommendations to protect your Azure resources.

## Penetration tests and red team exercises

*For more information, see [Security control: Penetration tests and red team exercises](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-penetration-tests-red-team-exercises).*

### 11.1: Conduct regular penetration testing of your Azure resources and ensure remediation of all critical security findings

**Guidance**: Follow the Microsoft Rules of Engagement to ensure your Penetration Tests are not in violation of Microsoft policies. Use Microsoftâ€™s strategy and execution of Red Teaming and live site penetration testing against Microsoft-managed cloud infrastructure, services, and applications.
