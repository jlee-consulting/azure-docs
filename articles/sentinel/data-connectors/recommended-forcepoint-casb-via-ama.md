# [Recommended] Forcepoint CASB via AMA connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Forcepoint CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) Connector allows you to automatically export CASB logs and events into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities across locations and cloud applications, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel.
