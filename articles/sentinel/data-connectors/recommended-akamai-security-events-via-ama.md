## Prerequisites

To integrate with [Recommended] Akamai Security Events via AMA make sure you have: 

- ****: To collect data from non-Azure VMs, they must have Azure Arc installed and enabled. [Learn more](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-install?tabs=ARMAgentPowerShell,PowerShellWindows,PowerShellWindowsArc,CLIWindows,CLIWindowsArc)
- ****: Common Event Format (CEF) via AMA and Syslog via AMA data connectors must be installed [Learn more](/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama#open-the-connector-page-and-create-the-dcr)


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias Akamai Security Events and load the function code or click [here](https://aka.ms/sentinel-akamaisecurityevents-parser), on the second line of the query, enter the hostname(s) of your Akamai Security Events device(s) and any other unique identifiers for the logstream. The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.


2. Secure your machine
