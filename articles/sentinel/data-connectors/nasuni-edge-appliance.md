Typically, you should install the agent on a different computer from the one on which the logs are generated.

>  Syslog logs are collected only from **Linux** agents.


2. Configure the logs to be collected

Follow the configuration steps below to configure your Linux machine to send Nasuni event information to Microsoft Sentinel. Refer to the [Azure Monitor Agent documenation](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) for additional details on these steps.
Configure the facilities you want to collect and their severities.
1. Select the link below to open your workspace agents configuration, and select the Syslog tab.
2. Select Add facility and choose from the drop-down list of facilities. Repeat for all the facilities you want to add.
3. Mark the check boxes for the desired severities for each facility.
4. Click Apply.



3. Configure Nasuni Edge Appliance settings

Follow the instructions in the [Nasuni Management Console Guide](https://view.highspot.com/viewer/629a633ae5b4caaf17018daa?iid=5e6fbfcbc7143309f69fcfcf) to configure Nasuni Edge Appliances to forward syslog events. Use the IP address or hostname of the Linux device running the Azure Monitor Agent in the Servers configuration field for the syslog settings.
