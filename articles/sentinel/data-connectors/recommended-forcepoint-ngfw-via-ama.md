# [Recommended] Forcepoint NGFW via AMA connector for Microsoft Sentinel

The Forcepoint NGFW (Next Generation Firewall) connector allows you to automatically export user-defined Forcepoint NGFW logs into Microsoft Sentinel in real-time. This enriches visibility into user activities recorded by NGFW, enables further correlation with data from Azure workloads and other feeds, and improves monitoring capability with Workbooks inside Microsoft Sentinel.
