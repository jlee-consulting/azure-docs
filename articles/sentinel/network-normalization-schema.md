# Azure Sentinel Network Session normalization schema reference (Public preview)

The Network Session normalization schema is used to describe an IP network activity. This includes network connections and network sessions. Such events are reported, for example, by operating systems, routers, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems and web security gateways.

For more information about normalization in Azure Sentinel, see [Normalization and the Azure Sentinel Information Model (ASIM)](normalization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes version 0.2 of the network normalization schema, where [version 0.1](normalization-schema-v1.md) was released before ASIM was available and does not align with ASIM in several places. For more information, see [Differences between network normalization schema versions](normalization-schema-v1.md#changes).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Network normalization schema is currently in PREVIEW. This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads.
>
> The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Support for common network telemetry sources

The network normalization schema can represent any IP network session, but is specifically designed to provide support for common source types, including:

- Netflow
- Firewalls
- Intrusion prevention systems
- Web servers
- Web security gateways

The following sections provide guidance on normalizing and using the schema for the different source types. Each source type may:
- Support additional fields from the auxiliary field lists: [Intermediary device fields](#Intermediary), [HTTP Session fields](#http-session-fields), and [Inspection fields](#inspection-fields). Some fields might be mandatory only in the context of the specific source type.
- Allow source type specific values to common event fields such as `EventType` and and `EventResult`.
- Support, in addition to the `imNetworkSession` parser, also either the `imWebSession` or `imNotable` parser, or both.

### Netflow log sources

| Task | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **Normalize Netflow events** | To normalize Netflow events, map them to [network session fields](#network-session-fields). Netflow telemetry supports aggregation, and the `EventCount` field value should reflect this, and be set to the Netflow *Flows* value. |
| **Use Netflow events** | Netflow events are surfaced as part of the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. When creating an aggregative query, make sure that you consider the `EventCount` field value, which may not always be set to `1`. |
| | |

### Firewall log sources

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Normalize firewall events** | To normalize events from firewalls, map relevant events to [event](#event-fields), [network session](#network-session-fields), and [session inspection](#inspection-fields) fields. Filter those events and add them to the [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. |
| **Use Firewall Events** | Firewall events are surfaced as part of the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. Relevant events, identified by the firewall inspection engines, are also surfaced as part of the [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parsers. |
| | |

### Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) log sources

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Normalize IPS events** | To normalize events from intrusion prevention systems, map [event fields](#event-fields), [network session fields](#network-session-fields), and [session inspection fields](#inspection-fields). Make sure to include your source-specific parser in both both the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) and [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parsers. |
| **Use IPS events** | IPS events are surfaced as part of the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) and [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parsers. |
| | |

### Web servers

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Normalize Web Servers Events** | To normalize events from a web server, map [Event fields](#event-fields), [Network Session fields](#network-session-fields), and [HTTP Session fields](#http-session-fields). Make sure to set the `EventType` value to `HTTP Session`, and follow the HTTP session-specific guidance for the `EventResult` and `EventResultDetails` fields. <br><br>Make sure to include your source-specific parser in both the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) and [imWebSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parsers. |
| **Use Web Server Events** | Web Server events are surfaced as part of the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. However, to use any HTTP-specific fields, use the [imWebSession](#use-parsers) parser. |
| | |

### Web security gateways

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Normalize Web Security Gateways Events** | To normalize events from a web server gateway, map [event fields](#event-fields), [network session fields](#network-session-fields), [HTTP session fields](#http-session-fields), [session inspection fields](#inspection-fields), and optionally the intermediary fields. <br><br>Make sure to set the `EventType` to `HTTP`, and follow HTTP session-specific guidance for the `EventResult` and `EventResultDetails` fields. <br><br>Make sure you include your source-specific parser in both the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) and [imWebSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parsers. Also, filter any events detected by the inspection engine and add them to the [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. |
| **Use Web Security Gateways Events** | Web Server events are surfaced as part of the [imNetworkSession](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. <br><br>- To use any HTTP-specific fields, use the [imWebSession](#use-parsers) parser.<br>- To analyze detected sessions, use the [imNotables](#use-parsers) source-agnostic parser. |
| | |


## Use parsers

To use a source-agnostic parser that unifies all built-in parsers, and ensure that your analysis runs across all configured sources, use any of the following parsers:


- **imNetworkSession**, for all network sessions
- **imWebSession**, for HTTP sessions, typically reported by web servers, web proxies, and web security gateways
- **imNotables**, for sessions detected by a detection engine, usually as suspicious. Notable events are typically reported by intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, and web security gateways.

Deploy the [source-agnostic and source-specific parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md) from the [Azure Sentinel GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelNetworkSession).

## Add your own normalized parsers

When implementing custom parsers for the Network Session information model, name your KQL functions using the following syntax: `imNetworkSession<vendor><Product>`. This function should map all fields relevant for the source.

Add your KQL function to the relevant source agnostic parsers as needed, depending on their log sources. For more information, see:

- [Netflow log sources](#netflow-log-sources)
- [Firewall log sources](#firewall-log-sources)
- [Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) log sources](#intrusion-prevention-systems-ips-log-sources)
- [Web Servers](#web-servers)
- [Web Security Gateways](#web-security-gateways)

## Schema details

The Network Sessions information model is aligned is the [OSSEM Network entity schema](https://github.com/OTRF/OSSEM/blob/master/docs/cdm/entities/network.md).

To conform with industry best practices, the Network Session schema uses the descriptors **Src** and **Dst** to identify the network session source and destination devices, without including the token **Dvc** in the field name.

So, for example, the source device hostname and IP address are named **SrcHostname** and **SrcIpAddr** respectively, and not **Src*Dvc*Hostname** and **Src*Dvc*IpAddr**. The prefix **Dvc** is only used for the reporting or intermediary device, as applicable.

Fields that describe the user and application associated with the source and destination devices also use the **Src** and **Dst** descriptors.

Other ASIM schemas typically use **Target** instead of **Dst**.

### Log Analytics fields

The following fields are generated by Log Analytics for each record, and can be overridden when [creating a custom connector](create-custom-connector.md).


| Field | Type | Discussion |
|-------|------|------------|
| <a name="timegenerated"></a>**TimeGenerated** | datetime | The time the event was generated by the reporting device. |
| **\_ResourceId** | guid | The Azure Resource ID of the reporting device or service, or the log forwarder resource ID for events forwarded using Syslog, CEF or WEF. |
| **Type** | String | The original table from which the record was fetched. This field is useful when the same event can be received through multiple channels to different tables, but have the same `EventVendor` and `EventProduct` values. <br><br>For example, a Sysmon event can be collected either to the **Event** table or to the **SecurityEvent** table. |
| | | |

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics also adds other fields that are less relevant to security use cases. For more information, see [Standard columns in Azure Monitor Logs](../azure-monitor/logs/log-standard-columns.md).
