# Connect your Cisco Umbrella to Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Cisco Umbrella connector is currently in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

[!INCLUDE [reference-to-feature-availability](includes/reference-to-feature-availability.md)]

The Cisco Umbrella connector allows you to connect to Amazon Web Services S3 buckets, via the S3 API, to ingest Cisco Umbrella security solution logs into Azure Sentinel.

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Configure and connect Cisco Umbrella

Cisco Umbrella can integrate and export logs into Azure Sentinel via the Amazon S3 API.

1. In the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Data connectors**.

1. From the **Data connectors** gallery, select **Cisco Umbrella (Preview)** and then **Open connector page**.

1. Follow the steps described in the **Configuration** section of the connector page.

## Find your data

After a successful connection is established, the data appears in **Logs**, under the **CustomLogs** section, in one or more of the following tables:
- `Cisco_Umbrella_dns_CL`
- `Cisco_Umbrella_proxy_CL`
- `Cisco_Umbrella_ip_CL`
- `Cisco_Umbrella_cloudfirewall_CL`

## Validate connectivity

It may take up to 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics.
