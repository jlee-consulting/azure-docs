## Deploy SAP security content

Deploy the [SAP security content](sap-solution-security-content.md) from the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub** and **Watchlists** areas.

Deploying the **Microsoft Sentinel - Threat Monitoring for SAP** solution causes the SAP data connector to be displayed in the Microsoft Sentinel **Data connectors** area. The solution also deploys the **SAP - System Applications and Products** workbook and SAP-related analytics rules.

To deploy SAP solution security content, do the following:

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left pane, select **Content hub (Preview)**.

    The **Content hub (Preview)** page displays a filtered, searchable list of solutions.

1. To open the SAP solution page, select **Threat Monitoring for SAP**.

1. To launch the solution deployment wizard, select **Create**, and then enter the details of the Azure subscription, resource group, and Log Analytics workspace (the one used by Microsoft Sentinel) where you want to deploy the solution.

1. Select **Next** to cycle through the **Data Connectors**, **Analytics**, and **Workbooks** tabs, where you can learn about the components that will be deployed with this solution.

    For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for SAP solution: security content reference (public preview)](sap-solution-security-content.md).

1. On the **Review + create tab** pane, wait for the **Validation Passed** message, then select **Create** to deploy the solution.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also select **Download a template** for a link to deploy the solution as code.

1. After the deployment is completed, a confirmation message appears at the upper right.

    To display the newly deployed content, go to:

    - **Threat Management** > **Workbooks** > **My workbooks**, to find the [built-in SAP workbooks](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-workbooks).
    - **Configuration** > **Analytics** to find a series of [SAP-related analytics rules](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-analytics-rules).

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, go to the **Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for SAP** data connector to confirm the connection:

    SAP ABAP logs are displayed on the Microsoft Sentinel **Logs** page, under **Custom logs**:
