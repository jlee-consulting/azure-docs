# Deploy Threat Monitoring for SAP in Microsoft Sentinel

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](../includes/banner.md)]

This article introduces you to the process of deploying the Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring solution for SAP. The full process is detailed in a whole set of articles linked under [Deployment milestones](#deployment-milestones) below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for SAP solution is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Overview

**Threat Monitoring for SAP** is a [Microsoft Sentinel solution](../sentinel-solutions.md) that you can use to monitor your SAP systems and detect sophisticated threats throughout the business logic and application layers. The solution includes the following components:
- The SAP data connector for data ingestion.
- Analytics rules and watchlists for threat detection.
- Workbooks for interactive data visualization. 

The SAP data connector is an agent, installed on a VM or a physical server, that collects application logs from across the entire SAP system landscape. It then sends those logs to your Log Analytics workspace in Microsoft Sentinel. You can then use the other content in the Threat Monitoring for SAP solution – the analytics rules, workbooks, and watchlists – to gain insight into your organization's SAP environment and to detect and respond to security threats.
