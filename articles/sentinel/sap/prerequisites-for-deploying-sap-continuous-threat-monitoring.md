## Table of prerequisites

To successfully deploy the Threat Monitoring for SAP solution, you must meet the following prerequisites:

### Azure prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Access to Microsoft Sentinel** | Make a note of your Microsoft Sentinel *workspace ID* and *primary key*.<br>You can find these details in Microsoft Sentinel: from the navigation menu, select **Settings** > **Workspace settings** > **Agents management**. Copy the *Workspace ID* and *Primary key* and paste them aside for use during the deployment process. |
| *[Optional]* **Permissions to create Azure resources** | At a minimum, you must have the necessary permissions to deploy solutions from the Microsoft Sentinel content hub. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel content hub catalog](../sentinel-solutions-catalog.md). |
| *[Optional]* **Permissions to create an Azure key vault or access an existing one** | The recommended deployment scenario is to use Azure Key Vault to store secrets required to connect to your SAP system. For more information, see the [Azure Key Vault documentation](../../key-vault/index.yml). |

### System prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **System architecture** | The data connector component of the SAP solution is deployed as a Docker container, and each SAP client requires its own container instance.<br>The container host can be either a physical machine or a virtual machine, can be located either on-premises or in any cloud. <br>The VM hosting the container ***does not*** have to be located in the same Azure subscription as your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, or even in the same Azure AD tenant. |
| **Virtual machine sizing recommendations** | **Minimum specification**, such as for a lab environment:<br>*Standard_B2s* VM, with:<br>- 2 cores<br>- 4 GB RAM<br><br>**Standard connector** (default):<br>*Standard_D2as_v5* VM or<br>*Standard_D2_v5* VM, with: <br>- 2 cores<br>- 8 GB RAM<br><br>**Multiple connectors**:<br>*Standard_D4as_v5* or<br>*Standard_D4_v5* VM, with: <br>- 4 cores<br>- 16 GB RAM |
| **Administrative privileges** | Administrative privileges (root) are required on the container host machine. |
| **Supported Linux versions** | The SAP data connector agent has been tested with the following Linux distributions:<br>- Ubuntu 18.04 or higher<br>- SLES version 15 or higher<br>- RHEL version 7.7 or higher<br><br>If you have a different operating system, you may need to [deploy and configure the container manually](deploy-data-connector-agent-container.md?tabs=deploy-manually#deploy-the-data-connector-agent-container) instead of using the kickstart script. |
| **Network connectivity** | Ensure that the container host has access to: <br>- Microsoft Sentinel <br>- Azure key vault (in deployment scenario where Azure key vault is used to store secrets<br>- SAP system via the following TCP ports: *32xx*, *5xx13*, *33xx*, *48xx* (when SNC is used), where *xx* is the SAP instance number. |
| **Software utilities** | The [SAP data connector deployment script](reference-kickstart.md) installs the following required software on the container host VM (depending on the Linux distribution used, the list may vary slightly): <br>- [Unzip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/UnZip.html)<br>- [NetCat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/)<br>- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br>- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)<br>- [curl](https://curl.se/)<br><br>

### SAP prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Supported SAP versions** | The SAP data connector agent works best with [SAP_BASIS versions 750 SP13](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/software-downloads/support-package-stacks/product-versions.html#:~:text=SAP%20NetWeaver%20%20%20%20SAP%20Product%20Version,%20%20SAPKB710%3Cxx%3E%20%207%20more%20rows) or later. <br><br>Certain steps in this tutorial provide alternative instructions if you're working on the older [SAP_BASIS version 740](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/software-downloads/support-package-stacks/product-versions.html#:~:text=SAP%20NetWeaver%20%20%20%20SAP%20Product%20Version,%20%20SAPKB710%3Cxx%3E%20%207%20more%20rows). |
| **Required software** | SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK 7.50 ([Download here](https://aka.ms/sentinel4sapsdk))<br>Make sure that you also have an SAP user account in order to access the SAP software download page. |
| **SAP system details** | Make a note of the following SAP system details for use in this tutorial:<br>- SAP system IP address and FQDN hostname<br>- SAP system number, such as `00`<br>- SAP System ID, from the SAP NetWeaver system (for example, `NPL`) <br>- SAP client ID, such as `001` |
| **SAP NetWeaver instance access** | The SAP data connector agent uses one of the following mechanisms to authenticate to the SAP system: <br>- SAP ABAP user/password<br>- A user with an X.509 certificate (This option requires additional configuration steps) |

## SAP environment validation steps 

### Deploy SAP notes

Ensure the following SAP notes are deployed in your SAP system, according to its version:

> [!NOTE]
>
> Step-by-step instructions for deploying a CR and assigning the required role are available in the [**Deploying SAP CRs and configuring authorization**](preparing-sap.md) guide. Determine which CRs need to be deployed, retrieve the required CRs from the links in the tables below, and proceed to the step-by-step guide.

| SAP BASIS versions | Required note |
| --- | --- |
| - 750 SP01 to SP12<br>- 751 SP01 to SP06<br>- 752 SP01 to SP03 | [2641084 - Standardized read access to data of Security Audit Log](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2641084)* |
| - 700 to 702<br>- 710 to 711<br>- 730<br>- 731<br>- 740<br>- 750 | [2173545: CD: CHANGEDOCUMENT_READ_ALL](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2173545)* |
| - 700 to 702<br>- 710 to 711<br>- 730<br>- 731<br>- 740<br>- 750 to 752 | [2502336 - CD: RSSCD100 - read only from archive, not from database](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2502336)* |
| | * An SAP account is required to access SAP notes |

### Retrieve additional information from SAP

To enable the SAP data connector to retrieve certain information from your SAP system, you must deploy additional CRs from the [Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions/SAP/CR):
- **SAP BASIS 7.5 SP12 and above**: Client IP Address information from security audit log
- **ANY SAP BASIS version**: DB Table logs

| SAP BASIS versions | Recommended CR |
| --- | --- |
| - 750 and later | *NPLK900202*: [K900202.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/K900202.NPL), [R900202.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/R900202.NPL) |
| - 740  | *NPLK900201*: [K900201.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/K900201.NPL), [R900201.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/R900201.NPL) |

### Create and configure a role

To allow the SAP data connector to connect to your SAP system, you must create a role. Create the role by deploying CR **NPLK900206**. 

Experienced SAP administrators may choose to create the role manually and assign it the appropriate permissions. In such a case, it is not necessary to deploy the CR *NPLK900206*, but you must instead create a role using the recommendations outlined in [Expert: Deploy SAP CRs and deploy required ABAP authorizations](preparing-sap.md#required-abap-authorizations). 

| SAP BASIS versions | Sample CR |
| --- | --- |
| Any version  | *NPLK900206*: [K900206.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/K900206.NPL), [R900206.NPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/master/Solutions/SAP/CR/R900206.NPL) |

## Next steps

After verifying that all the prerequisites have been met, proceed to the next step to deploy the required CRs to your SAP system and configure authorization.
