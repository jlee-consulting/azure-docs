# Version compatibility with Fluid Framework releases

> [!NOTE]
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

To connect your application to Azure Fluid Relay service,
you'll use the **@fluidframework/azure-client** library. You'll also use the **fluid-framework** library to use the core
data structures and provided by the Fluid Framework.

Since you are using Azure Fluid Relay, you should first install the latest available version of
@fluidframework/azure-client and use that version to determine what version of the fluid-framework library to use. The library expresses a *peer dependency* on the version of the fluid-framework package on
which it depends.

You can use the [install-peerdeps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps) tool to install both
@fluidframework/azure-client and the compatible version of fluid-framework using the following command:

```bash
npx install-peerdeps @fluidframework/azure-client
```

> [!TIP]
> If building with any pre-release version of of **@fluidframework/azure-client** and **fluid-framework** we strongly recommend that you update to the latest 1.0 version. Earlier versions will not be
> supported with the General Availability of Azure Fluid Relay. With this upgrade, youâ€™ll make use of our new multi-region routing capability where
> Azure Fluid Relay will host your session closer to your end users to improve customer experience. In the latest package, you will need to update your
> serviceConfig object to the new Azure Fluid Relay service endpoint instead of the storage and orderer endpoints:
> If your Azure Fluid Relay resource is in West US 2, please use **`https://us.fluidrelay.azure.com`**. If it is West Europe, 
> use **`https://eu.fluidrelay.azure.com`**. If it is in Southeast Asia, use **`https://global.fluidrelay.azure.com`**.
> These values can also be found in the "Access Key" section of the Fluid Relay resource in the Azure portal. The orderer and storage endpoints will be deprecated soon.
