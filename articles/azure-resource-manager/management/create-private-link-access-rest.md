# Use REST API to create private link for managing Azure resources

This article explains how you can use [Azure Private Link](../../private-link/index.yml) to restrict access for managing resources in your subscriptions.

[!INCLUDE [Create content](../../../includes/resource-manager-create-rmpl.md)]

## Create resource management private link

To create resource management private link, send the following request:

```http
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/{rmplName}?api-version=2020-05-01
```

In the request body, include the location you want for the resource:

```json
{
  "location":"{region}"
}
```

The operation returns:

```json
{  
  "id": "/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/{name}",
  "location": "{region}",
  "name": "{rmplName}",
  "properties": {
    "privateEndpointConnections": []
  },
  "resourceGroup": "{rgName}",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/resourceManagementPrivateLinks"
}
```

Note the ID that is returned for the new resource management private link. You'll use it for creating the private link association.

## Create private link association

To create the private link association, use:

```http
PUT
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/privateLinkAssociations/{GUID}?api-version=2020-05-01 
```

In the request body, include:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "privateLink": "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{rg-name}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/{rmplName}",
    "publicNetworkAccess": "enabled"
  }
}
```

The operation returns:

```json
{
  "id": {plaResourceId},
  "name": {plaName},
  "properties": {
    "privateLink": {rmplResourceId},
    "publicNetworkAccess": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "{tenantId}",
    "scope": "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{managementGroupId}"
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/privateLinkAssociations"
}
```

## Add private endpoint

This article assumes you already have a virtual network. In the subnet that will be used for the private endpoint, you must turn off private endpoint network policies. If you haven't turned off private endpoint network policies, see [Disable network policies for private endpoints](../../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md).

To create a private endpoint, use the following operation:

```http
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/{privateEndpointName}?api-version=2020-11-01
```

In the request body, set the `privateServiceLinkId` to the ID from your resource management private link. The `groupIds` must contain `ResourceManagement`. The location of the private endpoint must be the same as the location of the subnet.

```json
{
  "location": "westus2",
  "properties": {
    "privateLinkServiceConnections": [
      {
        "name": "{connection-name}",
        "properties": {
           "privateLinkServiceId": "/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/{name}",
           "groupIds": [
              "ResourceManagement"
           ]
         }
      }
    ],
    "subnet": {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subID}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet-name}/subnets/{subnet-name}"
    }
  }
}
```

The next step varies depending whether you're using automatic or manual approval. For more information about approval, see [Access to a private link resource using approval workflow](../../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md#access-to-a-private-link-resource-using-approval-workflow).

The response includes approval state.

```json
"privateLinkServiceConnectionState": {
    "actionsRequired": "None",
    "description": "",
    "status": "Approved"
},
```

If your request is automatically approved, you can continue to the next section. If your request requires manual approval, wait for the network admin to approve your private endpoint connection.
