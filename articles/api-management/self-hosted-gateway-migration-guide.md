# Self-hosted gateway migration guide

This article explains how to migrate existing self-hosted gateway deployments to self-hosted gateway v2.

## What's new?

As we strive to make it easier for customers to deploy our self-hosted gateway, we've **introduced a new configuration API** that removes the dependency on Azure Storage, unless you're using [API inspector](api-management-howto-api-inspector.md) or quotas.

The new configuration API allows customers to more easily adopt, deploy and operate our self-hosted gateway in their existing infrastructure.

We have [introduced new container image tags](how-to-self-hosted-gateway-on-kubernetes-in-production.md#container-image-tag) to let customers choose the best way to try our gateway and deploy it in production.

To help customers run our gateway in production we've extended [our production guidance](how-to-self-hosted-gateway-on-kubernetes-in-production.md) to cover how to autoscale the gateway, and deploy it for high availability in your Kubernetes cluster.

Learn more about the connectivity of our gateway, our new infrastructure requirements, and what happens if connectivity is lost in [this article](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#connectivity-to-azure).

## Prerequisites

Before you can migrate to self-hosted gateway v2, you need to ensure your infrastructure [meets the requirements](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#gateway-v2-requirements).

## Migrating to self-hosted gateway v2

Migrating from self-hosted gateway v2 requires a few small steps to be done:

1. [Use the new container image](#container-image)
2. [Use the new configuration API](#using-the-new-configuration-api)
3. [Meet minimal security requirements](#meet-minimal-security-requirements)

### Container Image

Change the image tag in your deployment scripts to use `2.0.0` or above.

Alternatively, choose one of our other [container image tags](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#container-images).

You can find a full list of available tags [here](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azure-api-management/gateway/tags/list) or find us on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-api-management-gateway).

### Using the new configuration API

In order to migrate to self-hosted gateway v2, customers need to use our new Configuration API v2.

Currently, Azure API Management provides the following Configuration APIs for self-hosted gateway:

| Configuration Service | URL | Supported | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v2 | `{name}.configuration.azure-api.net` | Yes | [Link](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#gateway-v2-requirements) |
| v1 | `{name}.management.azure-api.net/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg-name}/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/{name}?api-version=2021-01-01-preview` | No | [Link](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#gateway-v1-requirements) |

Customer must use the new Configuration API v2 by changing their deployment scripts to use the new URL and meet infrastructure requirements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * DNS hostname must be resolvable to IP addresses and the corresponding IP addresses must be reachable.
> This might require additional configuration in case you are using a private DNS, internal VNET or other infrastrutural requirements.

### Security

#### Available TLS cipher suites

At launch, self-hosted gateway v2.0 only used a subset of the cipher suites that v1.x was using. As of v2.0.4, we have brought back all the cipher suites that v1.x supported.

You can learn more about the used cipher suites in [this article](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#available-cipher-suites) or use v2.1.1 to [control what cipher suites to use](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#managing-cipher-suites).

#### Meet minimal security requirements

During startup, the self-hosted gateway will prepare the CA certificates that will be used. This requires the gateway container to run with at least user ID 1001 and can't use read-only file system.

When configuring a security context for the container in Kubernetes, the following are required at minimum:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```

However, as of `2.0.3` the self-hosted gateway is able to run as non-root in Kubernetes allowing customers to run the gateway more securely.

Here's an example of the security context for the self-hosted gateway:
```yml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001       # This is a built-in user, but you can use any user ie 1000 as well
  runAsGroup: 2000      # This is just an example
  privileged: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - all
```

> [!WARNING]
> Running the self-hosted gateway with read-only filesystem (`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`) is not supported.

## Known limitations

Here's a list of known limitations for the self-hosted gateway v2:

- Configuration API v2 doesn't support custom domain names
