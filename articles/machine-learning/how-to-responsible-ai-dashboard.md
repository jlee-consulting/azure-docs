# How to use the Responsible AI dashboard in studio (preview)

Responsible AI dashboards are linked to your registered models. To view your Responsible AI dashboard, go into your model registry and select the registered model you've generated a Responsible AI dashboard for. Once you select into your model, select the **Responsible AI (preview)** tab to view a list of generated dashboards.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/dashboard-model-details-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of model details tab in studio with Responsible A I tab highlighted." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/dashboard-model-details-tab.png":::

Multiple dashboards can be configured and attached to your registered model. Different combinations of components (explainers, causal analysis, etc.) can be attached to each Responsible AI dashboard. The list below only shows whether a component was generated for your dashboard, but different components can be viewed or hidden within the dashboard itself.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/dashboard-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Responsible A I tab with a dashboard name highlighted." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/dashboard-page.png":::

Selecting the name of the dashboard will open up your dashboard into a full view in your browser. At anytime, select the **Back to models details** to get back to your list of dashboards.

## Full functionality with integrated compute resource

Some features of the Responsible AI dashboard require dynamic, real-time computation. Without connecting a compute resource to the dashboard, you may find some functionality missing. Connecting to a compute resource will enable full functionality of your Responsible AI dashboard for the following components:

- **Error analysis**
    - Setting your global data cohort to any cohort of interest will update the error tree instead of disabling it.
    - Selecting other error or performance metrics is supported.
    - Selecting any subset of features for training the error tree map is supported.
    - Changing the minimum number of samples required per leaf node and error tree depth is supported.
    - Dynamically updating the heatmap for up to two features is supported.
- **Feature importance**
    - An individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot in the individual feature importance tab is supported.
- Counterfactual what-if
    - Generating a new what-if counterfactual datapoint to understand the minimum change required for a desired outcome is supported.
- **Causal analysis**
    - Selecting any individual datapoint, perturbing its treatment features, and seeing the expected causal outcome of causal what-if is supported (only for regression ML scenarios).

The information above can also be found on the Responsible AI dashboard page by selecting the information icon button:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-view-full-functionality.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Responsible A I tab dashboard hovering over the information icon button.":::

### How to enable full functionality of Responsible AI dashboard

1. Select a running compute instance from compute dropdown above your dashboard. If you don’t have a running compute, create a new compute instance by selecting “+ ” button next to the compute dropdown, or  “Start compute” button to start a stopped compute instance. Creating or starting a compute instance may take few minutes.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/select-compute.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to selecting a compute." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/select-compute.png":::
    
2. Once compute is in “Running” state, your Responsible AI dashboard will start to connect to the compute instance. To achieve this, a terminal process will be created on the selected compute instance, and Responsible AI endpoint will be started on the terminal. Select **View terminal outputs** to view current terminal process.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-connect-terminal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the responsible A I dashboard is connecting to a compute resource." lightbox = "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-connect-terminal.png":::

3. When your Responsible AI dashboard is connected to the compute instance, you'll see a green message bar, and the dashboard is now fully functional.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the dashboard is connected to the compute instance." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-connected.png":::

4. If it takes a while and your Responsible AI dashboard is still not connected to the compute instance, or a red error message bar shows up, it means there are issues with starting your Responsible AI endpoint. Select **View terminal outputs** and scroll down to the bottom to view the error message.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an error connecting to a compute." lightbox ="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/compute-terminal-error.png":::

    If you're having issues with figuring out how to resolve the failed to connect to compute instance issue, select the “smile” icon on the upper right corner, and submit feedback to us to let us know what error or issue you hit. You can include screenshot and/or your email address in the feedback form.

5. **Feature importance of [feature] (regression) or Feature importance of [feature] on [predicted class] (classification)**: plots the importance of a particular feature across the predictions. For regression scenarios, the importance values are in terms of the output so positive feature importance means it contributed positively towards the output; vice versa for negative feature importance.  For classification scenarios, positive feature importances mean that feature value is contributing towards the predicted class denoted in the y-axis title; and negative feature importance means it's contributing against the predicted class.
6. **View dependence plot for**: selects the feature whose importances you want to plot.
7. **Select a dataset cohort**: selects the cohort whose importances you want to plot.

#### Individual feature importances (local explanations)

This tab explains how features influence the predictions made on specific datapoints. You can choose up to five datapoints to compare feature importances for.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/individual-feature-importance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dashboard showing the individual feature importances tab." lightbox= "./media/how-to-responsible-ai-dashboard/individual-feature-importance.png":::

Select on “Set value” to set all the values of your own counterfactual datapoint in the bottom row with the values of the pre-generated counterfactual example.  
8. **Predicted value or class** lists the model prediction of a counterfactual's class given those changed features.
9. **Create your own counterfactual**: allows you to perturb your own features to modify the counterfactual, features that have been changed from the original feature value will be denoted by the title being bolded (ex. Employer and Programming language). Clicking on “See prediction delta” will show you the difference in the new prediction value from the original datapoint.
10. **What-if counterfactual name**: allows you to name the counterfactual uniquely.
11. **Save as new datapoint**: saves the counterfactual you've created.

### Causal analysis
