Choose how to treat the imported labels:

* As prelabeled data - choose this option to use the imported labels as prelabeled data. Your labeler can then review the prelabeled data and correct any errors before submitting the labels.
* As final labels - choose this option to import the labels as final labels. Only data that doesn't yet contain a label is presented as tasks to your labelers.
