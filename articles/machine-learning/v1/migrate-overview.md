# Migrate to Azure Machine Learning from Studio (classic)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for Machine Learning Studio (classic) ends on 31 August 2024. We recommend that you transition to [Azure Machine Learning](../overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md) by that date.
>
> After December 2021, you can no longer create new Studio (classic) resources. Through 31 August 2024, you can continue to use existing Studio (classic) resources.  
>
> Studio (classic) documentation is being retired and might not be updated in the future.

Learn how to migrate from Machine Learning Studio (classic) to Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning provides a modernized data science platform that combines no-code and code-first approaches.

This guide walks through a basic *lift and shift* migration. If you want to optimize an existing machine learning workflow, or modernize a machine learning platform, see the [Azure Machine Learning Adoption Framework](https://aka.ms/mlstudio-classic-migration-repo) for more resources, including digital survey tools, worksheets, and planning templates.

Please work with your cloud solution architect on the migration.

## Recommended approach

To migrate to Azure Machine Learning, we recommend the following approach:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Step 1: Assess Azure Machine Learning
> * Step 2: Define a strategy and plan
> * Step 3: Rebuild experiments and web services
> * Step 4: Integrate client apps
> * Step 5: Clean up Studio (classic) assets
> * Step 6: Review and expand scenarios

### Step 1: Assess Azure Machine Learning

1. Learn about [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/) and its benefits, costs, and architecture.

1. Compare the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning and Studio (classic).

    The following table summarizes the key differences.

    | Feature | Studio (classic) | Azure Machine Learning |
    |---| --- | --- |
    | Drag-and-drop interface | Classic experience | Updated experience: [Azure Machine Learning designer](../concept-designer.md)|
    | Code SDKs | Not supported | Fully integrated with Azure Machine Learning [Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/) and [R](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-sdk-for-r) SDKs |
    | Experiment | Scalable (10-GB training data limit) | Scale with compute target |
    | Training compute targets | Proprietary compute target, CPU support only | Wide range of customizable [training compute targets](../concept-compute-target.md#training-compute-targets); includes GPU and CPU support |
    | Deployment compute targets | Proprietary web service format, not customizable | Wide range of customizable [deployment compute targets](../concept-compute-target.md#compute-targets-for-inference); includes GPU and CPU support |
    | Machine learning pipeline | Not supported | Build flexible, modular [pipelines](../concept-ml-pipelines.md) to automate workflows |
    | MLOps | Basic model management and deployment; CPU-only deployments | Entity versioning (model, data, workflows), workflow automation, integration with CICD tooling, CPU and GPU deployments, [and more](../concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) |
    | Model format | Proprietary format, Studio (classic) only | Multiple supported formats depending on training job type |
    | Automated model training and hyperparameter tuning |  Not supported | [Supported](../concept-automated-ml.md)<br><br> Code-first and no-code options |
    | Data drift detection | Not supported | [Supported](../v1/how-to-monitor-datasets.md) |
    | Data labeling projects | Not supported | [Supported](../how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) |
    | Role-based access control (RBAC) | Only contributor and owner role | [Flexible role definition and RBAC control](../how-to-assign-roles.md) |
    | AI Gallery | [Supported](https://gallery.azure.ai) | Not supported <br><br> Learn with [sample Python SDK notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) |

    >[!NOTE]
    > The **designer** feature in Azure Machine Learning provides a drag-and-drop experience that's similar to Studio (classic). However, Azure Machine Learning also provides robust [code-first workflows](../concept-model-management-and-deployment.md) as an alternative. This migration series focuses on the designer, since it's most similar to the Studio (classic) experience.

1. Verify that your critical Studio (classic) modules are supported in Azure Machine Learning designer. For more information, see the [Studio (classic) and designer component-mapping](#studio-classic-and-designer-component-mapping) table.

1. Create an [Azure Machine Learning workspace](../quickstart-create-resources.md).

### Step 2: Define a strategy and plan

1. Define business justifications and expected outcomes.

1. Align an actionable Azure Machine Learning adoption plan to business outcomes.

1. Prepare people, processes, and environments for change.

Please work with your cloud solution architect to define your strategy.

For planning resources, including a planning doc template, see the [Azure Machine Learning Adoption Framework](https://aka.ms/mlstudio-classic-migration-repo).

### Step 3: Rebuild your first model

After you define a strategy, migrate your first model.

1. [Migrate a dataset to Azure Machine Learning](migrate-register-dataset.md).

1. Use the Azure Machine Learning designer to [rebuild an experiment](migrate-rebuild-experiment.md).

1. Use the Azure Machine Learning designer to [redeploy a web service](migrate-rebuild-web-service.md).

    >[!NOTE]
    > This guidance is built on top of Azure Machine Learning v1 concepts and features. Azure Machine Learning has CLI v2 and Python SDK v2. We suggest that you rebuild your Studio (classic) models using v2 instead of v1. Start with [Azure Machine Learning v2](../concept-v2.md).

### Step 4: Integrate client apps

Modify client applications that invoke Studio (classic) web services to use your new [Azure Machine Learning endpoints](migrate-rebuild-integrate-with-client-app.md).

### Step 5: Clean up Studio (classic) assets

To avoid extra charges, [clean up Studio (classic) assets](../classic/export-delete-personal-data-dsr.md). You might want to retain assets for fallback until you've validated Azure Machine Learning workloads.

### Step 6: Review and expand scenarios

1. Review the model migration for best practices and validate workloads.

1. Expand scenarios and migrate more workloads to Azure Machine Learning.

## Studio (classic) and designer component-mapping

Consult the following table to see which modules to use while rebuilding Studio (classic) experiments in the Azure Machine Learning designer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The designer implements modules through open-source Python packages rather than C# packages like Studio (classic). Because of this difference, the output of designer components might vary slightly from their Studio (classic) counterparts.

### What if a designer component is missing?

Azure Machine Learning designer contains the most popular modules from Studio (classic). It also includes new modules that take advantage of the latest machine learning techniques.

If your migration is blocked due to missing modules in the designer, contact us by [creating a support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

## Example migration

The following migration example highlights some of the differences between Studio (classic) and Azure Machine Learning.

### Datasets

In Studio (classic), *datasets* were saved in your workspace and could only be used by Studio (classic).

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of automobile price datasets in Studio classic." lightbox="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-dataset.png":::

In Azure Machine Learning, *datasets* are registered to the workspace and can be used across all of Azure Machine Learning. For more information on the benefits of Azure Machine Learning datasets, see [Data in Azure Machine Learning](concept-data.md).

### Pipeline

In Studio (classic), *experiments* contained the processing logic for your work. You created experiments with drag-and-drop modules.

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-experiment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of automobile price experiments in Studio classic." lightbox="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-experiment.png":::

In Azure Machine Learning, *pipelines* contain the processing logic for your work. You can create pipelines with either drag-and-drop modules or by writing code.

### Web service endpoints

Studio (classic) used *REQUEST/RESPOND API* for real-time prediction and *BATCH EXECUTION API* for batch prediction or retraining.

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-web-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of endpoint API in classic." lightbox="media/migrate-overview/studio-classic-web-service.png":::

Azure Machine Learning uses *real-time endpoints* (managed endpoints) for real-time prediction and *pipeline endpoints* for batch prediction or retraining.
