  - name: Quotas
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I request a quota increase?
        answer: |
          [Request a quota increase in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal) with **Azure Container Apps** selected as the provider.

          Keep in mind the following when it comes to quota increase requests: 

          - **Scaling apps vs environments**: There are many different quotas available to increase. Use these descriptions to help identify your needs:
            - **Increase apps and cores per environment**: Allows you to run more apps within an environment and/or more intensive apps. Recommended if your workloads can deploy within the same network and security boundaries.
            - **Increasing environments**: Recommended if your workloads need network or security boundaries. Note: A detailed business context might be required if your request involves increasing environment-level quotas.

          - **Regions**: Approvals for increase requests vary based on compute capacity available in Azure regions.

          - **Specific compute requirements**: The platform supports 4 GB per container app. Memory limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

          - **Business reasoning for scaling**: You might be eligible for a quota increase request if the platform limits are blocking your workload demands. Scale limits overrides are evaluated on a per-case basis.

  - name: Dapr
    questions:
      - question: |
          What Dapr features and APIs are available in Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          Each Dapr capability undergoes thorough evaluation to ensure it positively impacts customers running microservices in the Azure Container Apps environment, while providing the best possible experience.

      - question: |
          Are alpha Dapr APIs and Tier 2 components supported or available in Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          The availability of Dapr's alpha APIs is not guaranteed or Microsoft-supported.
 
          While Tier 1 components are fully supported, Tier 2 components are supported with best effort. [Learn more.](./dapr-overview.md#supported-dapr-apis-components-and-tooling)

      - question: |
          What is the Dapr version release cadence in Azure Container Apps?
        answer: |
          Dapr's typical release timeline is up to six weeks after [the Dapr OSS release](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/). The latest Dapr version is made available in Azure Container Apps after rigorous testing. Rolling out to all regions can take roughly up to two weeks.

      - question: |
          How can I request a Dapr feature enhancement for Azure Container Apps?
        answer:
          You can submit a feature request via the [Azure Container Apps GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues/new/choose). Make sure to include "Dapr" in the feature request title.

  - name: Dockerless deployments
    questions:
     - question: |
         What is a Docker-less deployment?
       answer: |
         A Docker-less deployment allows you to deploy your application without defining a Dockerfile in your code. Instead, the Container Apps cloud build functionality uses Buildpacks to turn source code on your local machine into a container image. This option uses the Azure Container Apps default registry.
     - question: |
         During the deployment of my Docker-less application, messages about "ImagePullBackOff on legion", "Kubernetes error" or "Gateway error" appear and my application doesn't deploy successfully.
       answer: |
         You are experiencing a known issue with Docker-less deployments. Retrying might resolve this for you. If you run into this issue, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues) so our team can investigate.

  - name: Deploy .NET applications
    questions:
    - question: |
        What if my .NET application fails to scale?
      answer: |
        You need to enable data protection for all .NET apps on Azure Container Apps. See [Deploying and scaling an ASP.NET Core app on Azure Container Apps](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/scaling-aspnet-apps/scaling-aspnet-apps) for details.        
        
  - name: Deploy Java applications
    questions:
      - question: |
          Which JDK versions are supported and how can I configure the JDK version?
        answer: |
          Container Apps supports four LTS JDK versions: JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 17 and JDK 21. 
          For source code build, the default version is JDK 17.
          For a JAR file build, the JDK version is read from the file location *META-INF\MANIFEST.MF* in the JAR, but uses the default JDK version 17 if the specified version isn't available.

          You can configure JDK version to override the default version via [build environment variables](java-build-environment-variables.md).
      - question: |
          Which Java build tools are supported?
        answer: |
          Maven
      - question: |
          How can I customize a Java image build from source code?
        answer: |
          You can customize a Java image build via [build environment variables](java-build-environment-variables.md).
      - question: |
          How do I ensure the build and image of my Docker-less build are available in the same region as my app?
        answer: |
          When using `containerapp up` in combination with a Docker-less code base, use the `--location` parameter so that application runs in a location other than US East.
