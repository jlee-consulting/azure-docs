# Application Logging in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides two types of application logging categories:

-  [Container console logs](#container-console-logs): Log streams from your container console.
-  [System logs](#system-logs): Logs generated by the Azure Container Apps service.


## Container console Logs

Container console logs are written by your application to the `stdout` and `stderr` output streams of the application's container. By implementing detailed logging in your application, you'll be able to troubleshoot issues and monitor the health of your application. 

You can view your container console logs through [Logs streaming](log-streaming.md).  For other options to store and monitoring your log data, see [Logging options](log-options.md).

## System logs

System logs are generated by the Azure Container Apps to inform you for the status of service level events.  Log messages include the following information:

- Successfully created dapr component
- Successfully updated dapr component
- Error creating dapr component
- Successfully mounted volume
- Error mounting volume
- Successfully bound Domain
- Auth enabled on app. Creating authentication config
- Auth config created successfully
- Setting a traffic weight 
- Creating a new revision:
- Successfully provisioned revision
- Deactivating Old revisions
- Error provisioning revision

The system log data can be stored and monitored through the Container Apps logging options.  For more information, see [Logging options](log-options.md).
