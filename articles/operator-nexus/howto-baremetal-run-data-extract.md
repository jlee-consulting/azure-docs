# Troubleshoot bare metal machine issues using the `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract` command

There may be situations where a user needs to investigate and resolve issues with an on-premises bare metal machine. Azure Operator Nexus provides a prescribed set of data extract commands via `az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract`. These commands enable users to get diagnostic data from a bare metal machine.

The command produces an output file containing the results of the data extract located in the Cluster Manager's Azure Storage Account.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you've installed the Azure command line interface and the `networkcloud` command line interface extension. For more information, see [How to Install CLI Extensions](./howto-install-cli-extensions.md).
- The target bare metal machine is on and has readyState set to True.
- The syntax for these commands is based on the 0.3.0+ version of the `az networkcloud` CLI.
- Get the Cluster Managed Resource group name (cluster_MRG) that you created for Cluster resource.

## Verify Storage Account access

Verify you have access to the Cluster Manager's storage account
  1. From Azure portal, navigate to Cluster Manager's Storage account.
  1. In the Storage account details, select **Storage browser** from the navigation menu on the left side.
  1. In the Storage browser details, select on **Blob containers**.
  1. If you encounter a `403 This request is not authorized to perform this operation.` while accessing the storage account, storage accountâ€™s firewall settings need to be updated to include the public IP address.
  1. Request access by creating a support ticket via Portal on the Cluster Manager resource. Provide the public IP address that requires access.

## Executing a run command

The run data extract command executes one or more predefined scripts to extract data from a bare metal machine.

The current list of supported commands are

- [SupportAssist/TSR collection for Dell troubleshooting](#hardware-support-data-collection)\
  Command Name: `hardware-support-data-collection`\
  Arguments: Type of logs requested
  - `SysInfo` - System Information
  - `TTYLog` - Storage TTYLog data
  - `Debug` - debug logs

- [Collect Microsoft Defender for Endpoints (MDE) agent information](#collect-mde-agent-information)\
  Command Name: `mde-agent-information`\
  Arguments: None

- [Collect MDE diagnostic support logs](#collect-mde-support-diagnostics)\
  Command Name: `mde-support-diagnostics`\
  Arguments: None

- [Collect Dell Hardware Rollup Status](#hardware-rollup-status)\
  Command Name: `hardware-rollup-status`\
  Arguments: None

- [Generate Cluster CVE Report](#generate-cluster-cve-report)\
  Command Name: `cluster-cve-report`\
  Arguments: None

The command syntax is:

```azurecli-interactive
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "<machine-name>"  \
  --resource-group "<cluster_MRG>" \
  --subscription "<subscription>" \
  --commands '[{"arguments":["<arg1>","<arg2>"],"command":"<command1>"}]'  \
  --limit-time-seconds "<timeout>"
```

Specify multiple commands using json format in `--commands` option. Each `command` specifies command and arguments. For a command with multiple arguments, provide as a list to the `arguments` parameter. See [Azure CLI Shorthand](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/shorthand_syntax.md) for instructions on constructing the `--commands` structure.

These commands can be long running so the recommendation is to set `--limit-time-seconds` to at least 600 seconds (10 minutes). The `Debug` option or running multiple extracts might take longer than 10 minutes.

In the response, the operation performs asynchronously and returns an HTTP status code of 202. See the [Viewing the Output](#viewing-the-output) section for details on how to track command completion and view the output file.

### Hardware Support Data Collection

This example executes the `hardware-support-data-collection` command and get `SysInfo` and `TTYLog` logs from the Dell Server. The script executes a `racadm supportassist collect` command on the designated baremetal machine. The resulting tar.gz file contains the zipped extract command file outputs in `hardware-support-data-<timestamp>.zip`.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"arguments":["SysInfo", "TTYLog"],"command":"hardware-support-data-collection"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

### Collect MDE Agent Information

Data is collected with the `mde-agent-information` command and formatted as JSON
to `/hostfs/tmp/runcommand/mde-agent-information.json`. The JSON file is found
in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The script executes a
sequence of `mdatp` commands on the designated baremetal machine.

This example executes the `mde-agent-information` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"mde-agent-information"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

  "threatInformation": {
      "list": $threat_info_list,
      "quarantineList": $threat_info_quarantine_list
    }
}
```

### Collect MDE Support Diagnostics

Data collected from the `mde-support-diagnostics` command uses the MDE Client Analyzer tool to bundle information from `mdatp` commands and relevant log files.  The storage account `tgz` file will contain a `zip` file named `mde-support-diagnostics-<hostname>.zip`. The `zip` should be sent along with any support requests to ensure the supporting teams can use the logs for troubleshooting and root cause analysis, if needed.

This example executes the `mde-support-diagnostics` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"mde-support-diagnostics"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

### Hardware Rollup Status

Data is collected with the `hardware-rollup-status` command and formatted as JSON to `/hostfs/tmp/runcommand/rollupStatus.json`. The JSON file is found
in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The data collected will show the health of the machine subsystems.

This example executes the `hardware-rollup-status` command without arguments.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "clusete_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \

### Generate Cluster CVE Report

Vulnerability data is collected with the `cluster-cve-report` command and formatted as JSON to `{year}-{month}-{day}-nexus-cluster-vulnerability-report.json`. The JSON file is found in the data extract zip file located in the storage account. The data collected will include vulnerability data per container image in the cluster.

This example executes the `cluster-cve-report` command without arguments.

> [!NOTE]
> The target machine must be a control-plane node or the action will not execute.

```azurecli
az networkcloud baremetalmachine run-data-extract --name "bareMetalMachineName" \
  --resource-group "cluster_MRG" \
  --subscription "subscription" \
  --commands '[{"command":"cluster-cve-report"}]' \
  --limit-time-seconds 600
```

__CVE Data Details__

The CVE data is refreshed per container image every 24-hours based on Kubernetes resource instantiation or whenever there is a change to the Kubernetes resource referencing the image (whichever occurs first).

## Viewing the Output

Note the provided link to the tar.gz zipped file from the command execution. The tar.gz file name identifies the file in the Storage Account of the Cluster Manager resource group. You can also use the link to directly access the output zip file. The tar.gz file also contains the zipped extract command file outputs. Download the output file from the storage blob to a local directory by specifying the directory path in the optional argument `--output-directory`.
Note: Storage Account could be locked resulting in `403 This request is not authorized to perform this operation.` due to networking or firewall restrictions. Refer [Verify Storage Account access](#verify-storage-account-access) for procedure to verify/request access.
