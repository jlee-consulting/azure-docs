# Deploy virtual machines effectively using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can help you deploy [virtual machines in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/overview) that are efficient and effective. You can get suggestions for different options to save costs and choose the right type and size for your VMs.

For best results, start on the **Virtual machines** page in Azure. When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure for help with a VM, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context isn't clear, you'll be prompted to specify the VM for which you want assistance.

While it can be helpful to have some familiarity with different VM configuration options such as pricing, scalability, availability, and size can be beneficial, Microsoft Copilot in Azure is designed to help you regardless of your level of expertise. In all cases, we recommend that you closely review the suggestions to confirm that they meet your needs.

Microsoft Copilot in Azure can guide you in suggesting different options to save costs as you deploy a virtual machine. If you're new to creating VMs, Microsoft Copilot in Azure can help you understand the best ways to reduce costs More experienced users can confirm the best ways to make sure VMs align with both use cases and budget needs, or find ways to make a specific VM size more cost-effective by enabling certain features that might help lower overall cost.

### Sample prompts

- How do I reduce the cost of my virtual machine?
- Help me create a cost-efficient virtual machine
- Help me create a low cost VM

### Examples

During the VM creation process, you can ask "**How do I reduce the cost of my virtual machine?**" Microsoft Copilot in Azure guides you through options to make your VM more cost-effective, providing options that you can enable.
