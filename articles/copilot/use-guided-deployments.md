# Create resources using guided deployments from Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can help you deploy certain resources and workloads by providing one-click or step-by-step deployment assistance.

Guided deployments are currently available for select workloads. For other types of deployments, Copilot in Azure helps by [providing links to templates](#template-suggestions) that you can customize and deploy, often with various deployment options such as Azure CLI, Terraform, Bicep, or ARM. If a template isn't available for your scenario, Copilot in Azure provides information to help you choose and deploy the best resources for your scenario.

## Deploy a LEMP stack on an Azure Linux VM

Copilot in Azure can help you deploy an NGINX web server, Azure MySQL Flexible Server, and PHP (the [LEMP stack](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-lemp-stack)) on an Ubuntu Linux VM in Azure. To see the LEMP server in action, you can also install and configure a WordPress site. You can choose either a one-click deployment, or step-by-step assistance.

### LEMP stack sample prompts

- "I want to deploy a LEMP stack on Ubuntu VM"
- "How do I create a single VM LEMP stack?
- "I need a step-by-step guide to create a LEMP stack on a Linux VM. Can you help?"
- "Guided deployment for creating a LEMP stack infrastructure on Azure"
- "One click deployment for LEMP stack"

### LEMP stack example

You can say "**I want to deploy a LEMP stack on a Ubuntu VM**". Copilot in Azure checks for deployment experiences, and presents you with two deployment options: **Step-by-Step** or **One-Click**.

If you choose **Step-by-step deployment** and select a subscription, Copilot in Azure launches a guided experience that walks you through each step of the deployment.

After you complete your deployment, you can check and browse the WordPress website running on your VM.

## Create a Linux virtual machine and connect via SSH

Copilot in Azure can help you [create a Linux VM and connect to it via SSH](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-cli). You can choose either a one-click deployment, or step-by-step assistance to handle the necessary tasks, including installing the latest Ubuntu image, provisioning the VM, generating a private key, and establishing the SSH connection.

### Linux VM sample prompts

- "How do I deploy a Linux VM?"
- "What are the steps to create a Linux VM on Azure and how do I SSH into it?"
- "I need a detailed guide on creating a Linux VM on Azure and establishing an SSH connection."
- "Deploy a Linux VM on Azure infrastructure."
- "Learn mode deployment for Linux VM"

### Linux VM example

You can say "**How do I create a Linux VM and SSH into it?**". You'll see two deployment options: **Step-by-Step deployment** or **One-Click**. If you choose the one-click option and select a subscription, you can run the script to deploy the infrastructure. While the deployment is running, don't close or refresh the page. You'll see progress as each step of the deployment is completed.

- "How do I make a scalable AKS cluster?"
- "I'm new to AKS. Can you help me deploy a cluster?"

## Template suggestions

If a guided deployment isn't available, Copilot in Azure checks to see if there's a template available to help with your scenario. Where possible, multiple deployment options are provided, such as Azure CLI, Terraform, Bicep, or ARM. You can then download and customize the templates as desired.

If a template isn't available, Copilot in Azure provides information to help you achieve your goal. You can also revise your prompt to be more specific or ask if there are any related templates you could start from.
