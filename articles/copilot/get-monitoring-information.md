# Get information about Azure Monitor metrics, logs, and alerts using Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview)

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure for this information, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context of a query isn't clear, you'll be prompted to specify the resource for which you want information.
