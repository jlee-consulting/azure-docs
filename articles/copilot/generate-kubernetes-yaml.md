# Create Kubernetes YAML files using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can help you create [Kubernetes YAML files](/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#deployments-and-yaml-manifests) to apply [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) clusters. Generated YAML files adhere to best practices so that you can focus more on your applications and less on the underlying infrastructure. You can also get help when authoring your own YAML files by asking Microsoft Copilot to make changes, fix problems, or explain elements in the context of your specific scenario.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure for help with Kubernetes YAML files, it prompts you to open the YAML deployment editor. From there, you can use Microsoft Copilot in Azure help you create, edit, and format the desired YAML file to create your cluster.

## Get help working with Kubernetes files in the YAML editor

Once Microsoft Copilot in Azure has generated a YAML file for you, you can continue to work in the YAML editor to make changes. You can also start from scratch and enter your own YAML directly into the editor. In the YAML editor, Microsoft Copilot in Azure offers several features that help you quickly create valid YAML files.

When working in the AKS YAML editor, enter **ALT + I** to open an inline Copilot prompt.
