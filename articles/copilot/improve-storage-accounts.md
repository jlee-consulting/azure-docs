# Improve security and resiliency of storage accounts using Microsoft Copilot in Azure

Microsoft Copilot in Azure (preview) can provide contextual and dynamic responses to harden the security posture and enhance data resiliency of [storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

Responses are dynamic and based on your specific storage account and settings. Based on your prompts, Microsoft Copilot in Azure runs a security check or a data resiliency check, and provides specific recommendations to improve your storage account.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot in Azure about improving security accounts, it automatically pulls context when possible, based on the current conversation or on the page you're viewing in the Azure portal. If the context isn't clear, you'll be prompted to specify the storage resource for which you want information.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to improve and protect your storage accounts. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts to get advice on specific areas.

- "How can I make this storage account more secure?"
- "Does this storage account follow security best practices?"
- "Is this storage account vulnerable?"
- "How can I prevent this storage account from being deleted?"
- "How do I protect this storage account's data from data loss or theft?"
- "Prevent malicious users from accessing this storage account."

## Examples

You can ask "**How can I make this storage account more secure?**" If you're already working with a storage account, Microsoft Copilot in Azure asks if you'd like to run a security check on that resource. If it's not clear which storage account you're asking about, you'll be prompted to select one. After the check, you'll see specific recommendations about things you can do to align your storage account with security best practices.

You can also say things like "**Prevent this storage account from data loss during a disaster recovery situation**." After confirming you'd like Microsoft Copilot in Azure to run a data resiliency check, you'll see specific recommendations for protecting its data.
