# Subscription eligibility and number capabilities

Numbers can be purchased on eligible Azure subscriptions and in geographies where Communication Services is legally eligible to provide them.

## Subscription eligibility

To acquire a phone number, you need to be on a paid Azure subscription. Phone numbers can't be acquired on trial accounts or by Azure free credits.

Additional details on eligible subscription types are as follows:

| Number Type                      | Eligible Azure Agreement Type                                                                             |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toll-Free and Local (Geographic) | Modern Customer Agreement (Field and Customer Led), Modern Partner Agreement (CSP), Enterprise Agreement* |
| Short-Codes                      | Modern Customer Agreement (Field Led) and Enterprise Agreement Only                                       |

\* Allowing the purchase of Italian phone numbers for CSP and LSP customers is planned only for General Availability launch. 

## Number capabilities

The capabilities that are available to you depend on the country that you're operating within (your Azure billing address location), your use case, and the phone number type that you've selected. These capabilities vary by country due to regulatory requirements.
