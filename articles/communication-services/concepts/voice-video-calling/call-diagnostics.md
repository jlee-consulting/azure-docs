# Call diagnostics

When working with calls in Azure Communication Services, issues or problems may arise that cause issues for your customers. To aid with that we have a feature called "Call Diagnostics" which enables you to examine various properties of a Call to determine what the issue might be.

**Call diagnostics, is currently only supported for our JS / Web SDK.**

## Accessing diagnostics

Call diagnostics is an extended feature of the core `Call` API and allows you to diagnose an active call.

```js
const callDiagnostics = call.api(Features.Diagnostics);
```

## Diagnostic values

The following users facing diagnostics are available:

### Network values

## Diagnostic events

- Subscribe to the `diagnosticChanged` event to monitor when any call diagnostic changes.

```js
/**
 *  Each diagnostic has the following data:
 * - diagnostic is the type of diagnostic, e.g. NetworkSendQuality, DeviceSpeakWhileMuted, etc...
 * - value is DiagnosticQuality or DiagnosticFlag:
 *     - DiagnosticQuality = enum { Good = 1, Poor = 2, Bad = 3 }.
 *     - DiagnosticFlag = true | false.
 * - valueType = 'DiagnosticQuality' | 'DiagnosticFlag'
 * - mediaType is the media type associated with the event, e.g. Audio, Video, ScreenShare. These are defined in `CallDiagnosticEventMediaType`.
 */
const diagnosticChangedListener = (diagnosticInfo: NetworkDiagnosticChangedEventArgs | MediaDiagnosticChangedEventArgs) => {
    console.log(`Diagnostic changed: ` +
        `Diagnostic: ${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic}` +
        `Value: ${diagnosticInfo.value}` +
        `Value type: ${diagnosticInfo.valueType}` +
        `Media type: ${diagnosticInfo.mediaType}` +

    if (diagnosticInfo.valueType === 'DiagnosticQuality') {
        if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Bad) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic} is bad quality`);

        } else if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Poor) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic} is poor quality`);
        }

    } else if (diagnosticInfo.valueType === 'DiagnosticFlag') {
        if (diagnosticInfo.value === true) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic}`);
        }
    }
};

callDiagnostics.network.on('diagnosticChanged', diagnosticChangedListener);
callDiagnostics.media.on('diagnosticChanged', diagnosticChangedListener);
```

## Get the latest diagnostics

- Get the latest call diagnostic values that were raised. If a diagnostic is undefined, that is because it was never raised.

```js
const latestNetworkDiagnostics = callDiagnostics.network.getLatest();

console.log(
  `noNetwork: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.noNetwork.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.noNetwork.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `networkReconnect: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReconnect.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReconnect.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `networkReceiveQuality: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReceiveQuality.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReceiveQuality.valueType}`
);

const latestMediaDiagnostics = callDiagnostics.media.getLatest();

console.log(
  `speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `cameraStartFailed: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.cameraStartFailed.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.cameraStartFailed.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `microphoneNotFunctioning: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.microphoneNotFunctioning.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.microphoneNotFunctioning.valueType}`
);
```
