:::image type="content" source="./media/whats-new-images/11-23/advanced-call-automation-actions.png" alt-text="A graphic showing a server interacting with the cloud":::

Azure AI-powered Call Automation API actions are now generally available for developers who want to create enhanced calling workflows using Azure AI Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech and other language understanding engines. These actions allow developers to play dynamic audio prompts and recognize voice input from callers, enabling natural conversational experiences and more efficient task handling. Developers can use these actions with any of the four major SDKs - .NET, Java, JavaScript and Python - and integrate them with their Azure OpenAI solutions to create virtual assistants that go beyond simple IVRs. You can learn more about this release and its capabilities from the Microsoft Ignite 2023 announcements blog and on-demand session.

These APIs allow developers to classify, queue, and distribute jobs to the most suitable workers based on various routing rules, using any of the three major SDKs - .NET, JavaScript, and Python. You can learn more about Job Router and how to use it with Azure AI Services from the Ignite 2023 announcement blog and prerecorded video.

### Managed Identities in Public Preview
:::image type="content" source="./media/whats-new-images/11-23/managed-identities.png" lightbox="./media/whats-new-images/10-23/number-lookup-lightbox.png" alt-text="A banner showing images representing identity and security.":::

Azure Communication Services now supports Azure Managed Identities, which are a feature of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)) that allow resources to securely authenticate with other Azure services that support Entra authentication. Managed Identities is an [Azure Enterprise Promise](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) that improves security and simplifies workflows for customers, as they don't need to embed security credentials into their code. Managed Identities can be used in Azure Communication Services for various scenarios, such as connecting Cognitive Services, Azure Storage, and Key-Vault. You can learn more about this feature and how to use it from the Ignite 2023 announcement blog and prerecorded video.
