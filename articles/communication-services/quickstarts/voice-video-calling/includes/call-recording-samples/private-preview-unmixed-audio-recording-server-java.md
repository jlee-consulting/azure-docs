> [!NOTE]
> Call Recording Unmixed audio is available in the US only and may change based on feedback we receive during the Private Preview stage.


## Prerequisites

Before you start testing Unmixed Audio recording, make sure you complete the following steps:

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Services resource](../../../create-communication-resource.md). You'll need to record your resource **connection string** for this quickstart.
- Subscribe to events via [Azure Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-schema-communication-services).
- Download the [Java SDK](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-java/maven/com.azure%2Fazure-communication-callingserver/overview/1.0.0-alpha.20220829.1 )
- This quickstart assumes you have some experience using the [Calling Client SDK](../../get-started-with-video-calling.md). **Important**: To fetch `serverCallId` from Calling SDK, refer to the [JavaScript](../../get-server-call-id.md) example.
- Make sure to provide the Azure Communication Services Call Recording team with your [immutable Azure resource ID](../../get-resource-id.md) to be allowlisted during the **private preview** tests.


## 1. Create a Call Automation client

To create a call automation client, you'll use your Communication Services connection string and pass it to `CallAutomationClient` object.

```java
CallAutomationClient callAutomationClient = new CallAutomationClientBuilder()
            .connectionString("<acsConnectionString>")
            .buildClient();
```

## 2. Start recording session with StartRecordingOptions using 'startRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the server call ID received during initiation of the call.
- RecordingContent is used to pass the recording content type. Use AUDIO
- RecordingChannel is used to pass the recording channel type. Use UNMIXED.
- RecordingFormat is used to pass the format of the recording. Use WAV.

```java
StartRecordingOptions recordingOptions = new StartRecordingOptions(new ServerCallLocator("<serverCallId>"))
                    .setRecordingChannel(RecordingChannel.UNMIXED)
                    .setRecordingFormat(RecordingFormat.WAV)
                    .setRecordingContent(RecordingContent.AUDIO)
                    .setRecordingStateCallbackUrl("<recordingStateCallbackUrl>");

Response<StartCallRecordingResult> response = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording()
.startRecordingWithResponse(recordingOptions, null);

```

### 2.1. Specify a user on a channel 0 for unmixed audio recording
To produce unmixed audio recording files, you can use the `ChannelAffinity` functionality to specify which user you want to record on each channel. Channel 0 typically records the agent attending or making the call. If you use the affinity channel but don't specify any user to any channel, Call Recording will assign channel 0 to the first person on the call speaking. 

```java
StartRecordingOptions recordingOptions = new StartRecordingOptions(new ServerCallLocator("<serverCallId>"))
                    .setRecordingChannel(RecordingChannel.UNMIXED)
                    .setRecordingFormat(RecordingFormat.WAV)
                    .setRecordingContent(RecordingContent.AUDIO)
                    .setRecordingStateCallbackUrl("<recordingStateCallbackUrl>")
                    .setChannelAffinity(List.of(
                            new ChannelAffinity(0, new CommunicationUserIdentifier("<participantMri>"));

Response<RecordingStateResult> response = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording()
.startRecordingWithResponse(recordingOptions, null);

```
The `startRecordingWithResponse` API response contains the recording ID of the recording session.

## 3.	Stop recording session using 'stopRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of `startRecordingWithResponse`.

```java
Response<Void> response = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording()
               .stopRecordingWithResponse(response.getValue().getRecordingId(), null);
```

## 4.	Pause recording session using 'pauseRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of `startRecordingWithResponse`.
```java
Response<Void> response = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording()
              .pauseRecordingWithResponse(response.getValue().getRecordingId(), null);
```

## 5.	Resume recording session using 'resumeRecordingWithResponse' server API

Use the recording ID received in response of `startRecordingWithResponse`.

```java
Response<Void> response = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording()
               .resumeRecordingWithResponse(response.getValue().getRecordingId(), null);
```

## 6.	Download recording File using 'downloadToWithResponse' server API

Use an [Azure Event Grid](../../../../../event-grid/overview.md) web hook or other triggered action should be used to notify your services when the recorded media is ready for download.

Below is an example of the event schema.

```
{
    "id": string, // Unique guid for event
    "topic": string, // /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Communication/communicationServices/{communication-services-resource-name}
    "subject": string, // /recording/call/{call-id}/serverCallId/{serverCallId}
    "data": {
        "recordingStorageInfo": {
            "recordingChunks": [
                {
                    "documentId": string, // Document id for the recording chunk
                    "contentLocation": string, //Azure Communication Services URL where the content is located
                    "metadataLocation": string, // Azure Communication Services URL where the metadata for this chunk is located
                    "deleteLocation": string, // Azure Communication Services URL to use to delete all content, including recording and metadata.
                    "index": int, // Index providing ordering for this chunk in the entire recording
                    "endReason": string, // Reason for chunk ending: "SessionEnded", "ChunkMaximumSizeExceeded”, etc.
                }
            ]
        },
        "recordingStartTime": string, // ISO 8601 date time for the start of the recording
        "recordingDurationMs": int, // Duration of recording in milliseconds
        "sessionEndReason": string // Reason for call ending: "CallEnded", "InitiatorLeft”, etc.
    },
    "eventType": string, // "Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated"
    "dataVersion": string, // "1.0"
    "metadataVersion": string, // "1"
    "eventTime": string // ISO 8601 date time for when the event was created
}
```

Use `downloadToWithResponse` method of `CallRecording` class for downloading the recorded media. Following are the supported parameters for `downloadToWithResponse` method:
- `contentLocation`: Azure Communication Services URL where the content is located.
- `destinationPath` : File location.
- `parallelDownloadOptions`: An optional ParallelDownloadOptions object to modify how the - parallel download will work.
- `overwrite`: True to overwrite the file if it exists.
- `context`: A Context representing the request context.


```java
Boolean overwrite = true;
ParallelDownloadOptions parallelDownloadOptions = null;
Context context = null;

String filePath = String.format(".\\%s.%s", documentId, fileType);
Path destinationPath = Paths.get(filePath);

Response<Void> downloadResponse = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().downloadToWithResponse(contentLocation, destinationPath, parallelDownloadOptions, overwrite, context);
```
The content location and document IDs for the recording files can be fetched from the `contentLocation` and `documentId` fields respectively, for each `recordingChunk`.

## 7. Delete recording content using ‘deleteRecordingWithResponse’ server API.

Use `deleteRecordingWithResponse` method of `CallRecording` class for deleting the recorded media. Following are the supported parameters for `deleteRecordingWithResponse` method:
- `deleteLocation`: Azure Communication Services URL where the content to delete is located.
- `context`: A Context representing the request context.

```
Response<Void> deleteResponse = callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().deleteRecordingWithResponse(deleteLocation, context);
```
The delete location for the recording can be fetched from the `deleteLocation` field of the Event Grid event.
