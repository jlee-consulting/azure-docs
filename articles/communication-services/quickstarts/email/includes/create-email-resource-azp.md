## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

## Create an Azure Email Communication Service resource

Select **Email Communication Services** in the results, and then select **Add**.

You can now configure your Email Communication Services resource. On the first page in the create process, you'll be asked to specify:

* The subscription
* The resource group (you can create a new one or choose an existing resource group)
* The name of the Email Communication Services resource
* The geography the resource will be associated with

In the next step, you can assign tags to the resource. Tags can be used to organize your Azure resources. See the [resource tagging documentation](../../../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md) for more information about tags.

Finally, you can review your configuration and **Create** the resource. Note that the deployment will take a few minutes to complete.

## Manage your Email Communication Services resource

To manage your Communication Services resource, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and search for and select **Azure Email Communication Services**.

On the **Email Communication Services** page, select the name of your resource.

The **Overview** page for your resource contains options for managing your email domains.
