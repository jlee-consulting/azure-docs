## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active Communication Services resource and connection string. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- Two or more Communication User Identities. [Create and manage access tokens](../../access-tokens.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) or [Quick-create identities for testing](../../identity/quick-create-identity.md).
- The latest version [.NET Core client library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your operating system.

## Sample code

You can review and download the sample code for this quick start on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-dotnet-quickstarts/tree/main/RoomsQuickstart).

## Setting up

### Create a new C# application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `RoomsQuickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: **Program.cs**.

```console
dotnet new console -o RoomsQuickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder and use the `dotnet build` command to compile your application.

```console
cd RoomsQuickstart
dotnet build
```

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication Rooms client library for .NET with [NuGet][https://www.nuget.org/]:

```console
dotnet add package Azure.Communication.Rooms
```
You'll need to use the Azure Communication Rooms client library for .NET [version 1.0.0-beta.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Communication.Rooms/1.0.0-beta.1) or above. 

### Initialize a room client

Create a new `RoomsClient` object that will be used to create new `rooms` and manage their properties and lifecycle. The connection string of your `Communications Service` will be used to authenticate the request. For more information on connection strings, see [this page](../../create-communication-resource.md#access-your-connection-strings-and-service-endpoints).

```csharp
// Find your Communication Services resource in the Azure portal
var connectionString = "<connection_string>";
RoomsClient roomsClient = new RoomsClient(connectionString);
```

### Create a room

Create a new `room` with default properties using the code snippet below:

```csharp
CommunicationRoom createdRoom = await RoomCollection.CreateRoomAsync(validFrom, validUntil, RoomJoinPolicy.InviteOnly, roomParticipants, cancellationToken);
string roomId = createdRoom.Id;
```

Since `rooms` are server-side entities, you may want to keep track of and persist the `roomId` in the storage medium of choice. You can reference the `roomId` to view or update the properties of a `room` object.

### Get properties of an existing room

Retrieve the details of an existing `room` by referencing the `roomId`:

```csharp
CommunicationRoom getRoomResponse = await roomsClient.GetRoomAsync(roomId);
```

### Update the lifetime of a room

The lifetime of a `room` can be modified by issuing an update request for the `ValidFrom` and `ValidUntil` parameters. A room can be valid for a maximum of six months.

```csharp
DateTimeOffset  validFrom = new DateTime(2022, 05, 01, 00, 00, 00, DateTimeKind.Utc);
DateTimeOffset  validUntil = validFrom.AddDays(1);

CommunicationRoom updatedRoom = await RoomCollection.UpdateRoomAsync(roomId, validFrom, validUntil, RoomJoinPolicy.InviteOnly, null, cancellationToken);

```

### Add new participants

To add new participants to a `room`, use the `AddParticipantsAsync` method exposed on the client.

```csharp
var communicationUser1 = "<CommunicationUserId1>";
var communicationUser2 = "<CommunicationUserId2>";
var communicationUser3 = "<CommunicationUserId3>";

List<RoomParticipant> participants = new List<RoomParticipant>();
participants.Add(new RoomParticipant(new CommunicationUserIdentifier(communicationUser1), "Presenter"));
participants.Add(new RoomParticipant(new CommunicationUserIdentifier(communicationUser2), "Attendee"));
participants.Add(new RoomParticipant(new CommunicationUserIdentifier(communicationUser3), "Attendee"));

var addParticipantsResult = await RoomCollection.AddParticipantsAsync(roomId, participants);
```

Participants that have been added to a `room` become eligible to join calls.

### Get list of participants

Retrieve the list of participants for an existing `room` by referencing the `roomId`:

```csharp
ParticipantsCollection existingParticipants = await RoomCollection.GetParticipantsAsync(roomId);
```

### Remove participants

To remove a participant from a `room` and revoke their access, use the `RemoveParticipantsAsync` method.

```csharp
var communicationUser = "<CommunicationUserId1>";

List<CommunicationIdentifier> participants = new List<CommunicationIdentifier>();
participants.Add(new CommunicationUserIdentifier(communicationUser));

var removeParticipantsResult = await RoomCollection.RemoveParticipantsAsync(roomId, participants);
```

### Delete room
If you wish to disband an existing `room`, you may issue an explicit delete request. All `rooms` and their associated resources are automatically deleted at the end of their validity plus a grace period.

```csharp
Response deleteRoomResponse = await RoomCollection.DeleteRoomAsync(createdRoomId);
```
