# Reactions
In this article, you learn how to implement the reactions capability with Azure Communication Services Calling SDKs. This capability allows users in a group call or meeting to send and receive reactions with participants in Azure Communication Services and Microsoft Teams. Reactions for users in Microsoft Teams are controlled by the configuration and policy settings in Teams. Additional information is available in [Manage reactions in Teams meetings and webinars](/microsoftteams/manage-reactions-meetings) and [Meeting options in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/meeting-options-in-microsoft-teams-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- A user access token to enable the calling client. For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to [add voice calling to your application](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md)

## Reaction in different call types
Reactions are supported by Azure Communication SDK in these types of calls:
 - Room Call, allowed by default
 - Group Call, allowed by default
 - Teams meeting, based on [Teams policy](/microsoftteams/manage-reactions-meetings)
 
Reactions are not supported for 1:1 call.

## Limits on reactions
Reactions are pulling by batches with same interval. Current batch limitation is 20k reactions with pulling time 3 seconds.
If the number of reactions exceeds the limit - they will be sent in second batch.
