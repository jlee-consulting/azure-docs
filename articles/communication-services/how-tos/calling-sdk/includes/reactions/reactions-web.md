## Send or receive a reaction from other participants
> [!NOTE]
> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. To use this api please use 'beta' release of Azure Communication Services Calling Web SDK version 1.18.1 or higher

Within Azure Communication Services you can send and receive reactions when on a group call:
- Like :::image type="icon" source="media/reaction-like.png":::
- Love :::image type="icon" source="media/reaction-love.png":::
- Applause :::image type="icon" source="media/reaction-applause.png":::
- Laugh :::image type="icon" source="media/reaction-laugh.png":::
- Surprise :::image type="icon" source="media/reaction-surprise.png":::

To send a reaction, use the `sendReaction(reactionMessage)` API. To receive a reaction, the message will be built with Type `ReactionMessage` that uses `Reaction` enums as an attribute. 

You need to subscribe for events that provide the subscriber event data:
```javascript
export interface ReactionEventPayload {
    /**
     * identifier for a participant
     */
    identifier: CommunicationUserIdentifier | MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier;
    /**
     * reaction type received
     */
    reactionMessage: ReactionMessage;
}
```

You can determine which reaction is coming from which participant with `identifier` attribute and gets the reaction type from `ReactionMessage`. 

### Sample on how to send a reaction in a meeting
```javascript
const reaction = call.feature(SDK.Features.Reaction);
const reactionMessage: SDK.ReactionMessage = {
       reactionType: 'like'
};
await reaction.sendReaction(reactionMessage);
```

### Sample on how to receive a reaction in a meeting
```javascript
const reaction = call.feature(SDK.Features.Reaction);
reaction.on('reaction', event => {
    // user identifier
    console.log("User Mri - " + event.identifier);
    // received reaction
    console.log("User Mri - " + event.reactionMessage.reactionType);
    // reaction message
    console.log("reaction message - " + JSON.stringify(event.reactionMessage));
}
```

### Key things to note about using Reactions:
- For Microsoft Teams interoperability scenarios, the functionality of the feature depends on the meeting policy for the reaction capability.
- Reactions are supported in the Web Calling SDK.
- Reactions are not currently supported in the Native SDKs.
