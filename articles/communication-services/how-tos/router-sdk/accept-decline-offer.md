## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A deployed Azure Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../quickstarts/create-communication-resource.md).
- Optional: Complete the quickstart to [get started with Job Router](../../quickstarts/router/get-started-router.md).

## Observe worker offer-issued events

After you create a job, observe the [worker offer-issued event](subscribe-events.md#microsoftcommunicationrouterworkerofferissued), which contains the worker ID and the job offer ID:

```csharp
var workerId = event.data.workerId;
var offerId = event.data.offerId;
Console.WriteLine($"Job Offer ID: {offerId} offered to worker {workerId} ");
     
```

## Accept job offers

The worker can accept job offers by using the SDK:

```csharp
var result = await client.AcceptJobOfferAsync(workerId, offerId);

```

## Decline job offers

The worker can decline job offers by using the SDK:

```csharp
var result = await client.DeclineJobOfferAsync(workerId, offerId);

```
