#  NC A100 v4-series  

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](~/articles/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life.md).

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NC A100 v4 series virtual machine (VM) is a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. 

The NC A100 v4 series is powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and third generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors.  The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80 GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. 
These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as: 

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Autonomy model training
- Oil and gas reservoir simulation
- Machine learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services



## Supported features

To get started with NC A100 v4 VMs, refer to [HPC Workload Configuration and Optimization](configure.md) for steps including driver and network configuration.

Due to increased GPU memory I/O footprint, the NC A100 v4 requires the use of [Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) and marketplace images. While the [Azure HPC images](configure.md) are  recommended, Azure HPC Ubuntu 20.04 and Azure HPC CentOS 7.9, RHEL 8.8, RHEL 9.2, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022 images are supported.

- [Ultra Disks](disks-types.md#ultra-disks): Not Supported
- [Live Migration](maintenance-and-updates.md): Not Supported
- [Memory Preserving Updates](maintenance-and-updates.md): Not Supported
- [VM Generation Support](generation-2.md): Generation 2
- [Accelerated Networking](../virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli.md): Supported
- [Ephemeral OS Disks](ephemeral-os-disks.md): Supported
- InfiniBand: Not Supported
- NVIDIA NVLink Interconnect: Supported
- [Nested Virtualization](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization): Not Supported

<sup>1</sup>  NC A100 v4 series VMs have a standard SCSI based temp resource disk for OS paging/swap file use. This ensures the NVMe drives can be fully dedicated to application use. This disk is Ephemeral, and all data will be lost on stop/deallocate.

<sup>2</sup> Local NVMe disks are ephemeral, data will be lost on these disks if you stop/deallocate your VM. Local NVMe disk is coming as RAM and it needs to be manually formatted in newly deployed VM.
