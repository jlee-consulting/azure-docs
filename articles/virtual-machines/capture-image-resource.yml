  Create a legacy managed image of a generalized VM in Azure

introduction: |
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This article covers the older managed image technology. For the most
    > current technology, customers are encouraged to use
    > [Azure Compute Gallery](azure-compute-gallery.md). All new features, like
    > ARM64, Trusted Launch, and Confidential VM are only supported through
    > Azure Compute Gallery. If you have an existing managed image, you can use
    > it as a source and create an Azure Compute Gallery image. For more
    > information, see
    > [Create an image definition and image version](image-version.md).
    >
    > Once you mark a VM as `generalized` in Azure, you cannot restart the VM.
    >
    > One managed image supports up to 20 simultaneous deployments. Attempting
    > to create more than 20 VMs concurrently, from the same managed image, may
    > result in provisioning timeouts due to the storage performance limitations
    > of a single VHD. To create more than 20 VMs concurrently, use an
    > [Azure Compute Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) (formerly known as
    > Shared Image Gallery) image configured with 1 replica for every 20
    > concurrent VM deployments.

    For information on how managed images are billed, see
    [Managed Disks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

      CLI: Create a legacy managed image of a VM
    summary: |
      Create a managed image of the VM with
      [az image create](/cli/azure/image#az-image-create). The following example
      creates an image named *myImage* in the resource group named
      *myResourceGroup* using the VM resource named *myVM*.

    code: |
      ```azurecli
      az image create \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myImage --source myVM
      ```
   
      > [!NOTE]
      > The image is created in the same resource group as your source VM. You
      > can create VMs in any resource group within your subscription from this
      > image. From a management perspective, you may wish to create a specific
      > resource group for your VM resources and images.
      >
      > If you are capturing an image of a generation 2 VM, also use the
      > `--hyper-v-generation V2` parameter. for more information, see
      > [Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md).
      >
      > If you would like to store your image in zone-resilient storage, you
      > need to create it in a region that supports
      > [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) and include
      > the `--zone-resilient true` parameter.
      
      This command returns JSON that describes the VM image. Save this output for later reference.

        PowerShell: Create a legacy managed image of a VM
    summary: |
      Creating an image directly from the VM ensures that the image includes all
      of the disks associated with the VM, including the OS disk and any data
      disks. This example shows how to create a managed image from a VM that
      uses managed disks.

      Before you begin, make sure that you have the latest version of the Azure
      PowerShell module. To find the version, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az`
      in PowerShell. If you need to upgrade, see
      [Install Azure PowerShell on Windows with PowerShellGet](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
      If you are running PowerShell locally, run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a
      connection with Azure.


      > [!NOTE]
      > If you would like to store your image in zone-redundant storage, you need to create it in a region that supports [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) and include the `-ZoneResilient` parameter in the image configuration (`New-AzImageConfig` command).

      To create a VM image, follow these steps:

    steps:
      - |
        Create some variables.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $vmName = "myVM"
        $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
        $location = "EastUS"
        $imageName = "myImage"
        ```
      - |
        Make sure the VM has been deallocated.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Force
        ```
      - |
        Set the status of the virtual machine to **Generalized**. 
   
        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Set-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Generalized
        ```
      - |
        Get the virtual machine. 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $vm = Get-AzVM -Name $vmName -ResourceGroupName $rgName
        ```
      - |
        Create the image configuration.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $image = New-AzImageConfig -Location $location -SourceVirtualMachineId $vm.Id 
        ```
      - |
        Create the image.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        New-AzImage -ImageName $imageName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Image $imageConfig
        ```

      PowerShell: Create a legacy managed image from a managed disk 
    summary: |
      If you want to create an image of only the OS disk, specify the managed
      disk ID as the OS disk: 
    steps:
      - |
        Create some variables. 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $vmName = "myVM"
        $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
        $location = "EastUS"
        $imageName = "myImage"
        ```
      - |

        Get the VM.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $vm = Get-AzVm -Name $vmName -ResourceGroupName $rgName
        ```
      - |

        Get the ID of the managed disk.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $diskID = $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.ManagedDisk.Id
        ```
      - |

        Create the image configuration.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $imageConfig = New-AzImageConfig -Location $location
        $imageConfig = Set-AzImageOsDisk -Image $imageConfig -OsState Generalized -OsType Windows -ManagedDiskId $diskID
        ```
      - |

        Create the image.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        New-AzImage -ImageName $imageName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Image $imageConfig
        ```

        PowerShell: Create a legacy managed image from a snapshot
    summary: |
      You can create a managed image from a snapshot of a generalized VM by following these steps:
    steps:
      - |

        Create some variables. 

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
        $location = "EastUS"
        $snapshotName = "mySnapshot"
        $imageName = "myImage"
        ```
      - |

        Get the snapshot.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $snapshot = Get-AzSnapshot -ResourceGroupName $rgName -SnapshotName $snapshotName
        ```
      - |

        Create the image configuration.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $imageConfig = New-AzImageConfig -Location $location
        $imageConfig = Set-AzImageOsDisk -Image $imageConfig -OsState Generalized -OsType Windows -SnapshotId $snapshot.Id
        ```
      - |
        Create the image.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        New-AzImage -ImageName $imageName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Image $imageConfig
        ```
  - title: | 
        PowerShell: Create a legacy managed image from a VM that uses a storage account
    summary: |
      To create a managed image from a VM that doesn't use managed disks, you
      need the URI of the OS VHD in the storage account, in the following
      format:
      https://*mystorageaccount*.blob.core.windows.net/*vhdcontainer*/*vhdfilename.vhd*.
      In this example, the VHD is in *mystorageaccount*, in a container named
      *vhdcontainer*, and the VHD filename is *vhdfilename.vhd*. 
    steps:
      - |
        Create some variables.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $vmName = "myVM"
        $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
        $location = "EastUS"
        $imageName = "myImage"
        $osVhdUri = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhdcontainer/vhdfilename.vhd"
        ```
      - |
        Stop/deallocate the VM.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Force
        ```
      - |
        Mark the VM as generalized.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        Set-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vmName -Generalized    
        ```
      - |
        Create the image by using your generalized OS VHD.

        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        $imageConfig = New-AzImageConfig -Location $location
        $imageConfig = Set-AzImageOsDisk -Image $imageConfig -OsType Windows -OsState Generalized -BlobUri $osVhdUri
        $image = New-AzImage -ImageName $imageName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Image $imageConfig
        ```

        CLI: Create a VM from a legacy managed image
    summary: |
      Create a VM by using the image you created with
      [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm). The following example creates a VM named
      *myVMDeployed* from the image named *myImage*. 
    code: |
      ```azurecli
      az vm create \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myVMDeployed \
        --image myImage\
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ```
  - title: | 
        CLI: Create a VM in another resource group from a legacy managed image
    summary: |
      You can create VMs from an image in any resource group within your
      subscription. To create a VM in a different resource group than the image,
      specify the full resource ID to your image. Use
      [az image list](/cli/azure/image#az-image-list) to view a list of images.
      The output is similar to the following example.

        ```json
        "id":
        "/subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/MYRESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/myImage",
        "location": "westus", "name": "myImage",
        ```

        The following example uses [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) to
        create a VM in a resource group other than the source image, by
        specifying the image resource ID.
    code: |
      ```azurecli
      az vm create \
        --resource-group myOtherResourceGroup \
        --name myOtherVMDeployed \
        --image "/subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/MYRESOURCEGROUP/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/myImage" \
        --admin-username azureuser \
        --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ```

        PowerShell: Create a VM from a legacy managed image
    summary: |
      You can use PowerShell to create a VM from an image by using the
      simplified parameter set for the
      [New-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) cmdlet. The image needs
      to be in the same resource group where you'll create the VM.

      The simplified parameter set for
      [New-AzVm](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) only requires that you
      provide a name, resource group, and image name to create a VM from an
      image. New-AzVm will use the value of the **-Name** parameter as the name
      of all of the resources that it creates automatically. In this example, we
      provide more detailed names for each of the resources but let the cmdlet
      create them automatically. You can also create resources beforehand, such
      as the virtual network, and pass the resource name into the cmdlet.
      New-AzVm will use the existing resources if it can find them by their
      name.

      The following example creates a VM named *myVMFromImage*, in the
      *myResourceGroup* resource group, from the image named *myImage*.
    code: |
        ```azurepowershell-interactive
        New-AzVm `
            -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" `
            -Name "myVMfromImage" `
            -ImageName "myImage" `
            -Location "East US" `
            -VirtualNetworkName "myImageVnet" `
            -SubnetName "myImageSubnet" `
            -SecurityGroupName "myImageNSG" `
            -PublicIpAddressName "myImagePIP" 
        ```
