# HBv2 series virtual machine overview

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](~/articles/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life.md).

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets.

Maximizing high performance compute (HPC) application performance on AMD EPYC requires a thoughtful approach memory locality and process placement. Below we outline the AMD EPYC architecture and our implementation of it on Azure for HPC applications. We use the term **pNUMA** to refer to a physical NUMA domain, and **vNUMA** to refer to a virtualized NUMA domain.

Physically, an [HBv2-series](hbv2-series.md) server is 2 * 64-core EPYC 7V12 CPUs for a total of 128 physical cores. Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) is disabled on HBv2. These 128 cores are divided into 16 sections (8 per socket), each section containing 8 processor cores. Azure HBv2 servers also run the following AMD BIOS settings:

```output
Nodes per Socket (NPS) = 2
L3 as NUMA = Disabled
NUMA domains within VM OS = 4
C-states = Enabled
```

As a result, the server boots with 4 NUMA domains (2 per socket) each 32 cores in size. Each NUMA has direct access to 4 channels of physical DRAM operating at 3200 MT/s.

To provide room for the Azure hypervisor to operate without interfering with the VM, we reserve 8 physical cores per server.

## VM topology

We reserve these 8 hypervisor host cores symmetrically across both CPU sockets, taking the first 2 cores from specific Core Complex Dies (CCDs) on each NUMA domain, with the remaining cores for the HBv2-series VM.
The CCD boundary isn't equivalent to a NUMA boundary. On HBv2, a group of four consecutive (4) CCDs is configured as a NUMA domain, both at the host server level and within a guest VM. Thus, all HBv2 VM sizes expose 4 NUMA domains that appear to an OS and application. 4 uniform NUMA domains, each with different number of cores depending on the specific [HBv2 VM size](hbv2-series.md).

Process pinning works on HBv2-series VMs because we expose the underlying silicon as-is to the guest VM. We strongly recommend process pinning for optimal performance and consistency.
