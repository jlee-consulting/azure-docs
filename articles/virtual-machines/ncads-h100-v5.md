#  NCads H100 v5-series 

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines (VMs) are a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. 
The NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines are powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU and 4th-generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ Genoa processors.  The VMs feature up to 2 NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs with 94GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Genoa processor cores and 640 GiB of system memory. 
These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as: 

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Autonomy model training
- Oil and gas reservoir simulation
- Machine learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services



## Supported features

To get started with NCads H100 v5 VMs, refer to [HPC Workload Configuration and Optimization](configure.md) for steps including driver and network configuration.

Due to increased GPU memory I/O footprint, the NCads H100 v5 requires the use of [Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) and marketplace images. Please follow instruction [Azure HPC images](configure.md) for configuration.

<sup>1</sup> 1 GPU = one H100 card <br>
<sup>2</sup> Local NVMe disks are ephemeral. Data is lost on these disks if you stop/deallocate your VM. Local NVMe disks aren't encrypted by Azure Storage encryption, even if you enable encryption at host. <br>
