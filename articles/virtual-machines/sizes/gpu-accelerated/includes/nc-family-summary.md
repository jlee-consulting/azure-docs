The 'NC' sub-family of VM size series are one of Azure's GPU-optimized VM instances. They're designed for compute-intensive workloads, such as AI and machine learning model training, high-performance computing (HPC), and graphics-intensive applications. Equipped with powerful NVIDIA GPUs, NC-series VMs offer substantial acceleration for processes that require heavy computational power, including deep learning, scientific simulations, and 3D rendering. This makes them particularly well-suited for industries such as technology research, entertainment, and engineering, where rendering and processing speed are critical to productivity and innovation.
