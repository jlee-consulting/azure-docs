NCv2-series VMs are powered by NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs. These GPUs can provide more than 2x the computational performance of the NC-series. Customers can take advantage of these updated GPUs for traditional HPC workloads such as reservoir modeling, DNA sequencing, protein analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and others. In addition to the GPUs, the NCv2-series VMs are also powered by Intel Xeon E5-2690 v4 (Broadwell) CPUs. The NC24rs v2 configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads.
