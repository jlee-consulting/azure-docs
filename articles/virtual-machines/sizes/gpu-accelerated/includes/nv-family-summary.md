The 'NV' family of VM size series are one of Azure's GPU-accelerated VM instances, specifically designed for graphics-intensive applications such as graphics rendering, simulation, and virtual desktops. Equipped with NVIDIA GPUs, NV-series VMs provide a robust platform for rendering and processing graphics-heavy tasks, making them ideal for organizations that require virtual workstations with powerful graphical capabilities. These VMs support scenarios where remote visualization, real-time collaboration, and 3D visualization are necessary, allowing users to efficiently run graphic-intensive applications directly from Azure's cloud environment.
