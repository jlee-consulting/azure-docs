**Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):** NV-family VMs are well-suited for virtual desktops that require GPU capabilities for tasks such as graphic design, video editing, and CAD applications. They provide the graphical performance necessary for smooth operation in remote desktop scenarios.

**3D Visualization:** NV-family VMs are ideal for running 3D applications that demand high-performance rendering, such as architectural visualizations, medical imaging, and other professional-grade graphics tasks.

**Remote Graphics Work:** NV-series VMs are beneficial for industries that rely on graphics-intensive software, allowing professionals to access and use applications like Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk AutoCAD, or Dassault SOLIDWORKS remotely with near-native performance.

**High-Resolution Image Processing:** NV-series VMs are ideal for handling extremely large vRAM applications such as high-resolution image processing and analysis. This includes tasks in fields like geospatial analysis, satellite image processing, and professional photo editing, where handling massive image files and performing complex manipulations in real-time are crucial for productivity and performance.

**Video Streaming:** NV-family VMs are suitable for streaming high-resolution video content, including training videos and virtual events, ensuring high-quality delivery without local hardware constraints.
