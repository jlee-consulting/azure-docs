**AI and Machine Learning:** NC-series VMs are ideal for training complex machine learning models and running AI applications. The NVIDIA GPUs provide significant acceleration for computations typically involved in deep learning and other intensive training tasks.

**High-Performance Computing (HPC):** These VMs are suitable for scientific simulations, rendering, and other HPC workloads that can be accelerated by GPUs. Fields like engineering, medical research, and financial modeling often use NC-series VMs to handle their computational needs efficiently.

**Graphics Rendering:** NC-series VMs are also used for graphics-intensive applications, including video editing, 3D rendering, and real-time graphics processing. They are particularly useful in industries such as game development and movie production.

**Remote Visualization:** For applications requiring high-end visualization capabilities, such as CAD and visual effects, NC-series VMs can provide the necessary GPU power remotely, allowing users to work on complex graphical tasks without needing powerful local hardware.

**Simulation and Analysis:** These VMs are also suitable for detailed simulations and analyses in areas like automotive crash testing, computational fluid dynamics, and weather modeling, where GPU capabilities can significantly speed up processing times.
