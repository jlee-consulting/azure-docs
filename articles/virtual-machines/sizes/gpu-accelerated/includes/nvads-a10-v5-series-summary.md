The NVadsA10v5-series virtual machines are powered by [NVIDIA A10](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/a10-gpu/) GPUs and AMD EPYCâ„¢ 74F3V (Milan) CPUs with a base frequency of 3.2 GHz, all-cores peak frequency of 4.0 GHz. With NVadsA10v5-series Azure is introducing virtual machines with partial NVIDIA GPUs. Pick the right sized virtual machine for GPU accelerated graphics applications and virtual desktops starting at 1/6th of a GPU with 4-GiB frame buffer to a full A10 GPU with 24-GiB frame buffer. Each virtual machine instance in NVadsA10v5-series comes with a GRID license. This license gives you the flexibility to use an NV instance as a virtual workstation for a single user, or 25 concurrent users can connect to the VM for a virtual application scenario.
