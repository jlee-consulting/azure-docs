The 'L' family of VM size series are one of Azure's storage-optimized VM instances. They're designed for workloads that require high disk throughput and I/O, such as databases, big data applications, and data warehousing. Equipped with high disk throughput and large local disk storage capacities, L-series VMs support applications and services that benefit from low latency and high sequential read and write speeds. This makes them particularly well-suited for handling tasks like large-scale log processing, real-time big data analytics, and scenarios involving large databases that perform frequent disk operations, ensuring efficient performance for storage-heavy applications.
