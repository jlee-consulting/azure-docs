**Big Data Applications:** L-family VMs are perfect for big data applications that need to process, analyze, and manipulate large datasets stored directly on local disks, benefiting from the high I/O performance.

**Database Servers:** L-family VMs provide the necessary local disk performance for SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other database servers that benefit from fast access to disk storage.

**File Servers:** L-family VMs can be used effectively as file servers within a network, handling large files and serving them with high throughput, especially useful in environments with large media files.

**Video Editing and Rendering:** The high disk throughput and capacity of L-family VMs are beneficial for video editing and rendering tasks, where large video files are frequently read and written to disk.
