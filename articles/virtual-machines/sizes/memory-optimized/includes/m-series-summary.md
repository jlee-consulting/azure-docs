The M-series offers a high vCPU count (up to 128 vCPUs) and a large amount of memory (up to 3.8 TiB). It's also ideal for extremely large databases or other applications that benefit from high vCPU counts and large amounts of memory. M-series sizes are supported both on the Intel速 Xeon速 CPU E7-8890 v3 @ 2.50GHz and on the Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8280M (Cascade Lake).
