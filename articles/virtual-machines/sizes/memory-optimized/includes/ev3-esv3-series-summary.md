The Ev3 and Esv3-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), or the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell) processor in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general purpose workloads, and bringing the Ev3 into alignment with the general purpose VMs of most other clouds.  Memory has been expanded (from 7 GiB/vCPU to 8 GiB/vCPU) while disk and network limits have been adjusted on a per core basis to align with the move to hyperthreading. The Ev3 is the follow up to the high memory VM sizes of the D/Dv2 families.
