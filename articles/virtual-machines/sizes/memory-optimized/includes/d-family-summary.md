The 'D' family of VM size series are one of Azure's memory-optimized VM instances. They're designed for memory-intensive workloads, such as relational databases, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. Equipped with more memory than the general-purpose D-series, these VMs offer a higher memory-to-core ratio, making them ideal for applications that require rapid access to larger volumes of data with intensive processing needs. This configuration supports efficient transaction processing and complex query operations, providing the necessary resources to maintain high performance and responsiveness under load.
