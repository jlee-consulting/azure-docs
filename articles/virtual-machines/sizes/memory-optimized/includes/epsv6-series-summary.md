The Epsv6-series virtual machines are powered by Azure’s first-generation Cobalt 100 processor, delivering outstanding performance for memory optimized workloads. The Azure Cobalt 100 processor operates at 3.4 GHz and provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer 8 GiB of memory per vCPU and a wide range of vCPU sizes. These VMs are best suited for memory-intensive scale-out and enterprise workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more. Epsv6-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. For more information, [see pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/). Epsv6-series virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM. These VMs come without local disk, providing a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temporary storage.
