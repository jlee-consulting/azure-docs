The Ebdsv5 and Ebsv5 series run on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration. The series are ideal for various memory-intensive enterprise applications. The Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs offer up to 260000 IOPS and 8000 MBps of remote disk storage throughput. Both series also include up to 672 GiB of RAM. The Ebdsv5 series has local SSD storage up to 3800 GiB. Both series provide a 3X increase in remote storage performance of data-intensive workloads compared to prior VM generations. You can use these series to consolidate existing workloads on fewer VMs or smaller VM sizes while achieving potential cost savings. The Ebdsv5 series comes with a local disk and Ebsv5 is without a local disk. We recommend choosing Premium SSD, Premium SSD v2 or Ultra disks to attain the published disk performance.
