The Ev5 and Esv5-series virtual machines run on Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), or Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a hyper threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) and [Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [Intel® Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). Featuring up to 672 GiB of RAM, these virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications, relational database servers, and in-memory analytics workloads. The Ev5 and Esv5-series provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temp disk.
