**Large Databases:** Ideal for running large relational and NoSQL databases that need to maintain large in-memory datasets for quick query responses and transaction processing.

**In-Memory Analytics:** Suitable for applications that perform real-time data analytics and need to process large data sets entirely in memory for faster analysis.

**Caching Solutions:** Efficient for caching scenarios where large volumes of data need to be stored in memory to provide rapid access and improve application performance, such as Redis or Memcached.
