**Memory-Intensive Workloads:** Any workload that demands a large memory footprint to efficiently handle tasks, such as simulations, large-scale computations in scientific research, or financial risk modeling.

**Large Databases and SQL Servers:** They are ideal for hosting large relational databases like SQL Server and NoSQL databases that benefit from high memory capacities for improved performance in data processing and transaction handling.

**Enterprise Applications:** Suitable for resource-intensive enterprise applications, including large-scale ERP and CRM systems, where the availability of ample memory is crucial for managing complex transactions and user loads.

**Big Data Applications:** Effective for big data analytics applications that need to process vast amounts of data in memory to speed up analysis and insights generation.

**In-Memory Computing:** Such as in-memory databases (e.g., SAP HANA) that require large amounts of RAM to keep the entire dataset in memory, allowing for ultra-fast data processing and query responses.

**Data Warehousing:** Provides the necessary resources for data warehousing solutions that handle and analyze large datasets, improving query performance and reducing response times.
