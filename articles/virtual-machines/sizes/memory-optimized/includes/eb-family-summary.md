The 'Eb' family of VM size series are one of Azure's memory-optimized VM instances. They're designed for memory-intensive workloads with high remote storage performance, such as large databases, big data analytics, and enterprise applications that require significant amounts of RAM to maintain high performance. Equipped with high memory-to-core ratios, Eb-series VMs support applications and services that benefit from faster data access and more efficient data processing capabilities. This makes them particularly well-suited for scenarios involving in-memory databases and extensive data processing tasks where ample memory is crucial for optimal performance.
