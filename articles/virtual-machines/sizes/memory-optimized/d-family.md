# 'D' family memory optimized VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

[!INCLUDE [d-family-summary](./includes/d-family-summary.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Memory optimized D family size series are designed for a specific set of workloads which require more memory than a standard D family "general purpose" instance but otherwise share identical specifications.
>
> If you're looking for more common general purpose D family VMs, check out the **[general purpose D family page](../general-purpose/d-family.md)**.
