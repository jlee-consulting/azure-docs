**Real-Time Data Processing:** NP-family VMs excel in environments where data needs to be processed in real time with minimal latency, such as in financial trading, real-time analytics, and network data processing.

**Custom AI and Machine Learning:** NP-family VMs are suitable for accelerating AI and machine learning inference tasks, where the FPGA can be programmed to execute specific algorithms sometimes faster than typical CPU or GPU-based solutions.

**Genomics and Life Sciences:** NP-family VMs can significantly speed up genomic sequencing tasks and other life sciences applications that benefit from custom hardware acceleration.

**Video Transcoding and Streaming:** FPGAs can be used to accelerate video processing tasks such as transcoding and real-time video streaming, optimizing performance and reducing processing times.

**Signal Processing:** NP-family VMs are ideal for applications in telecommunications and signal processing where rapid manipulation and analysis of signals are necessary.

**Database Acceleration:** NP-family VMs can enhance database operations, especially for custom search operations and large-scale database queries, by offloading these tasks to the FPGA.
