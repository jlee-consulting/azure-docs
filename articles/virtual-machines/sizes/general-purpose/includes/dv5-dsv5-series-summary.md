The Dv5 and Dsv5-series virtual machines run on Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8473C (Sapphire Rapids), Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These virtual machines offer a combination of vCPUs and memory to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more. The Dv5 and Dsv5-series provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temp disk. For information about similar virtual machines with local disk, see [Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series VMs](../../../ddv5-ddsv5-series.md).
