**Confidential Computing:** They support secure enclave technology using Intel SGX, which allows parts of the VM memory to be isolated from the main operating system. This enclave securely processes sensitive data, ensuring that it is protected even from privileged users and underlying system software.

**Data Protection:** DC-series VMs are ideal for applications that manage, store, and process sensitive data, such as personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, health records, and other types of confidential information. The hardware-based encryption ensures that data is protected at rest and during processing.

**Regulatory Compliance:** For businesses that need to comply with stringent regulatory requirements for data privacy and security (like GDPR, HIPAA, or financial industry regulations), DC-series VMs provide a hardware-assured environment that can help meet these compliance demands.
