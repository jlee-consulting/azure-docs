The Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) or the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. It features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz, [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) and [Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These new VM sizes will have 50% larger local storage, as well as better local disk IOPS for both read and write compared to the [Dv3/Dsv3](../../../dv3-dsv3-series.md) sizes with [Gen2 VMs](../../../generation-2.md). D-series use cases include enterprise-grade applications, relational databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.
