The 'DC' sub-family of VM size series are one of Azure's security focused general purpose VM instances. They're designed for [confidential computing](../../../../confidential-computing/overview-azure-products.md) with enhanced data protection and code confidentiality, featuring hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX). These VMs are ideal for handling highly sensitive data that demands isolation from the host environment, such as in scenarios involving secure enclaves for processing private data, financial transactions, and personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring a higher level of security for critical applications.
