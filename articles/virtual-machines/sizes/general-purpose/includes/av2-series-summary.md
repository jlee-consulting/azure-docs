The Av2-series VMs can be deployed on a variety of hardware types and processors. Av2-series run on the 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake), the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), the Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1 GHz (Skylake), the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors. Av2-series VMs have CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test. The size is throttled to offer consistent processor performance for the running instance, regardless of the hardware it is deployed on. To determine the physical hardware on which this size is deployed, query the virtual hardware from within the Virtual Machine. Some example use cases include development and test servers, low traffic web servers, small to medium databases, proof-of-concepts, and code repositories.
