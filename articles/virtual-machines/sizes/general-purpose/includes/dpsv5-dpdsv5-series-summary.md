The Dpsv5-series and Dpdsv5-series virtual machines are based on the Arm architecture, delivering outstanding price-performance for general-purpose workloads. These virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer a range of vCPU sizes, up to 4 GiB of memory per vCPU, and temporary storage options able to meet the requirements of scale-out and most enterprise workloads such as web and application servers, small to medium databases, caches, and more.
