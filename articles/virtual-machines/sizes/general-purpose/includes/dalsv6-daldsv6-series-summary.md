The Dalsv6-series and Daldsv6-series utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup>â€¯9004 processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 320 MB L3 cache. The Dalsv6 and Daldsv6 VM series provides 2GiBs of RAM per vCPU and are optimized for workloads that require less RAM per vCPU than standard VM sizes. The Dalsv6-series can reduce costs when running non-memory intensive applications, including web servers, gaming, video encoding, AI/ML, and batch processing.
