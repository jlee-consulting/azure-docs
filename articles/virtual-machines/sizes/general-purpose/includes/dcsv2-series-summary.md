The DCsv2-series virtual machines help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while it’s processed in the public cloud. DCsv2-series leverage Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which enable customers to use [secure enclaves](../../../../confidential-computing/confidential-computing-enclaves.md) for protection. These machines are backed by 3.7 GHz Intel® Xeon E-2288G (Coffee Lake) with SGX technology. With Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 these machines can go up to 5.0 GHz.
