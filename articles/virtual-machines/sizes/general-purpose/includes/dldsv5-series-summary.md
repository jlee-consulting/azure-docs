Dldsv5-series virtual machines run on the third Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM and fast, local SSD storage up to 3,600 GiB. These VM sizes can reduce cost when not running memory intensive applications.

Dldsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. See pricing for disks.
