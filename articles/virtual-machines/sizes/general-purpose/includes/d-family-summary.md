The 'D' family of VM sizes are one of Azure's general purpose VM sizes. They're designed for a variety of demanding workloads, such as enterprise applications, web and application servers, development and test environments, and batch processing tasks. Equipped with faster processors and more memory per core than the A-series, D-series VMs offer a strong performance balance, making them suitable for applications that require both high computational power and substantial memory resources. They are particularly favored for running enterprise-grade applications, supporting moderate to high-traffic web servers, and performing data-intensive batch processing.
