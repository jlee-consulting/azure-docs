These confidential VMs use AMD's third-Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache. These processors can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. Both series offer Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). SEV-SNP provides hardware-isolated VMs that protect data from other VMs, the hypervisor, and host management code. Confidential VMs offer hardware-based VM memory encryption. These series also offer OS disk pre-encryption before VM provisioning with different key management solutions.
