The DCsv3 and DCdsv3-series Azure Virtual Machines help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your code and data while they're being processed in the public cloud. By using Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions and Intel&reg; [Total Memory Encryption - Multi Key](https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/memory-encryption/), customers can ensure their data is always encrypted and protected in use. These machines are powered by 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon Scalable processors, and use Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 to reach 3.5 GHz. With this generation, CPU Cores have increased 6x (up to a maximum of 48 physical cores). Encrypted Memory (EPC) has increased 1500x to 256 GB. Regular Memory has increased 12x to 384 GB. All these changes substantially improve the performance and unlock entirely new scenarios.
