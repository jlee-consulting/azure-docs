The Falsv6, Fasv6, and Famsv6-series utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 9004 processor that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7GHz with up to 320 MB L3 cache.  The Falsv6, Fasv6, and Famsv6 VM series come without Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), meaning a vCPU is now mapped to a full physical core, allowing software processes to run on dedicated and uncontested resources. These new full core VMs will suit workloads demanding the highest CPU performance. Falsv6, Fasv6, and Famsv6-series offer up to 64 full core vCPUs and 512 GiB of RAM in three memory to core ratios, and are optimized for scientific simulations, financial and risk analysis, gaming, rendering and other workloads able to take advantage of the exceptional performance. Customers running software licensed on per-vCPU basis can leverage these VMs to optimize compute costs within their infrastructure.
