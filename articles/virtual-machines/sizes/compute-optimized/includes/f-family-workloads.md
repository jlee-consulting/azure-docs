**Web Servers:** F-series VMs are excellent for hosting web servers and applications that require significant compute capability to handle web traffic efficiently without necessarily needing large amounts of memory.

**Batch Processing:** F-series VMs are ideal for batch jobs and other processing tasks that involve handling large volumes of data or tasks in a queue but are more CPU-intensive than memory-intensive.

**Application Servers:** Applications that require quick processing and do not have high memory demands can benefit from F-series VMs. These can include medium traffic application servers, back-end servers for enterprise applications, and other similar tasks.
Gaming Servers: Due to their high CPU performance, F-series VMs are also suitable for gaming servers where fast processing is critical for a good gaming experience.

**Analytics:** F-series VMs can be used for data analytics applications that require processing speed to crunch numbers and perform calculations more than they require a large amount of memory.
