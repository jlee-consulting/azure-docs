The FX-series runs on the Intel® Xeon® Gold 6246R (Cascade Lake) processors. It features an all-core-turbo frequency of 4.0 GHz, 21 GB RAM per vCPU, up to 1 TB total RAM, and local temporary storage. The FX-series will benefit workloads that require a high CPU clock speed and high memory to CPU ratio, workloads with high per-core licensing costs, and applications requiring a high single-core performance. A typical use case for FX-series is the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workload. FX-series VMs feature [Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html), and [Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html).
