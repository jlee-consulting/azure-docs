The 'FX' family of VM size series are one of Azure's specialized compute-optimized VM instances, designed primarily workloads that require significant CPU capabilities. These VMs use the latest Intel Ice Lake processors and are optimized for compute-intensive tasks such as financial modeling, scientific simulations, and heavy calculations. With a high frequency and a large cache per core, FX-series VMs provide exceptional computational power, making them ideal for scenarios demanding extensive processing resources and rapid execution of complex operations.
