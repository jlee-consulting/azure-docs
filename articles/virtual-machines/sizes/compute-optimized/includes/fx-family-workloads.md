**Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**: FX-series VMs are well-suited for EDA workloads, which require high CPU clock speeds and high memory-to-CPU ratios. These workloads benefit from the high single-core performance and large memory capacity of FX-series VMs.

**Batch Processing:** FX-series VMs are excellent for high-throughput batch processing jobs, such as those involving large-scale data analysis and transformation, where rapid processing is critical.

**Data Analytics:** FX-series VMs are suitable for intensive data analytics applications, especially those that require quick iteration and processing of large data sets.
