The 'F' family of VM size series are one of Azure's compute-optimized VM instances. They're designed for workloads that require high CPU performance, such as batch processing, web servers, analytics, and gaming. Featuring a high CPU-to-memory ratio, F-series VMs are equipped with powerful processors to handle applications that demand more CPU capacity relative to memory. This makes them particularly effective for scenarios where fast and efficient processing is critical, allowing businesses to run their compute-bound applications efficiently and cost-effectively.
