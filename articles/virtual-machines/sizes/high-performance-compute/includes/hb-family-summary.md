The 'HB' subfamily of VM size series are one of Azure's high-performance computing (HPC) optimized H-family VM instances. They're designed for compute-intensive workloads, such as computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and large-scale scientific simulations. High-performance AMD EPYC processors and fast memory on HB-series VMs offer exceptional CPU and memory bandwidth, making them ideal for applications that require extensive computational resources to perform large-scale calculations and data processing. This makes them well suited for industries like engineering, scientific research, and data analysis where processing speed and accuracy are critical for productivity and innovation.
