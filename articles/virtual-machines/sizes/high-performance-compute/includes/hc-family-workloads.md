**Genomic Sequencing:** HC-series VMs provide the computational power needed for genomic sequencing, enabling researchers to process and analyze large genetic datasets quickly.

**Engineering Simulations:** Ideal for running complex simulations in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and mechanical engineering. These simulations often include finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

**Financial Modeling:** These VMs can handle the high demands of financial applications, including risk analysis and quantitative simulations, which require massive computational resources to execute many calculations quickly.

**Scientific Research:** HC-series VMs support a wide range of scientific computing needs, particularly in physics and chemistry, where large-scale computations and data analysis are crucial.

**Weather Forecasting and Climate Simulation:** They are used in meteorology for high-resolution weather modeling and climate simulations, which require processing large datasets and performing complex simulations.
