## Get started with Flexible orchestration mode

### Create a virtual machine scale set in Flexible orchestration mode through the Azure portal.

During the Flexible orchestration mode for scale sets preview, use the *preview* Azure portal linked in the steps below. 

1. Log into the Azure portal at https://preview.portal.azure.com.
1. In the search bar, search for and select **Virtual machine scale sets**.
1. Select **Create** on the **Virtual machine scale sets** page.
1. On the **Create a virtual machine scale set** page, view the **Orchestration** section.
1. For the **Orchestration mode**, select the **Flexible** option.
1. Set the **Fault domain count**.
1. Finish creating your scale set. See [create a scale set in the Azure portal](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/quick-create-portal.md#create-virtual-machine-scale-set) for more information on how to create a scale set.


### Next, add a virtual machine to the scale set in Flexible orchestration mode.

1. In the search bar, search for and select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select **Add** on the **Virtual machines** page.
1. In the **Basics** tab, view the **Instance details** section.
