# Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Extended Life Cycle Support

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article provides information on Extended Life Cycle Support for the Red Hat Enterprise images:
* General Extended Update Support policy
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Update Support

Microsoft Azure follows the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/#:~:text=Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux%20Version%208%20and%209,Support%20Phases%20followed%20by%20an%20Extended%20Life%20Phase.). If you have a valid Extended Update Support agreement from Red Hat or a Red Hat Partner you continue to receive support on Azure, including our integrated customer support  (subject to our [support terms](/troubleshoot/azure/cloud-services/support-linux-open-source-technology)).

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Life Cycle
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will reach permanent end of maintenance (including extended support) on June 30, 2024. Upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS), 8 or 9. Check [FAQ: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 reaches End of Maintenance Phase and transitions to Extended Life Phase](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4665701) for more details on RHEL6 ELS.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Life Cycle
Starting June 30, 2024, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 will reach the end of maintenance support 2 phase. The maintenance phase is followed by the Extended Life Phase. As Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 transitions out of the Full/Maintenance Phases, upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9. If customers must stay on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, it's recommended to add the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On.

1. "After" purchasing the SaaS offer from Marketplace, implement the steps outlined in [Enabling Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Life-cycle Support via Cloud Marketplaces](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-7-els-on-cloud) to configure the ELS add-on repos in Azure RHEL Virtual Machine.

#### What about RHEL 7 systems without ELS. Will they stop functioning? 
They continue to run but will no longer receive security updates and support, leaving customers at risk. Azure customer support will still assist customers with Azure specific issues but may not be able to assist customers further or refer them to Red Hat without active ELS add-on.
[FAQ: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 reaches End of Maintenance Phase and transitions to Extended Life Phase - Red Hat Customer Portal] (https://access.redhat.com/articles/7005471)

#### Why is the SaaS offer asking for Resource Group (RG) information when purchasing? 
Azure provides four levels of management: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. Resource Groups are used to organize your Azure resources more effectively. If you are applying the RHEL 7 ELS offer to VMs within a Resource Group, Azure prompts you for the name of the Resource Group. The offer is applied to each of the RHEL 7 ELS VMs within it.
