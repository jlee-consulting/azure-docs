# What is Azure Monitor for SAP solutions? (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Azure Monitor for SAP solutions public preview notice](./includes/preview-azure-monitor.md)]

When you have critical SAP applications and business processes that rely on Azure resources, you might want to monitor those resources for availability, performance, and operation. *Azure Monitor for SAP solutions* is an Azure-native monitoring product for SAP landscapes that run on Azure. Azure Monitor for SAP solutions uses specific parts of the [Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) infrastructure. You can use Azure Monitor for SAP solutions with both [SAP on Azure Virtual Machines (Azure VMs)](./hana-get-started.md) and [SAP on Azure Large Instances](./hana-overview-architecture.md). 

There are currently two versions of this product, *Azure Monitor for SAP solutions* and *Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic)*.

## What can you monitor?

You can use Azure Monitor for SAP solutions to collect data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location. Then, you can visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

To monitor different components of an SAP landscape (such as Azure VMs, high-availability clusters, SAP HANA databases, SAP NetWeaver, etc.), add the corresponding *[provider](./azure-monitor-providers.md)*. For more information, see [how to deploy Azure Monitor for SAP solutions through the Azure portal](azure-monitor-sap-quickstart.md).

The following table provides a quick comparison of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) and Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. 

| Azure Monitor for SAP solutions | Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Azure Functions-based collector architecture | VM-based collector architecture |
| Support for Microsoft SQL Server, SAP HANA, and IBM Db2 databases | Support for Microsoft SQL Server, and SAP HANA databases |

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions uses the [Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) capabilities of [Log Analytics](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) and [Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). With it, you can:

- Create [custom visualizations](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) by editing the default workbooks provided by Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. 
- Write [custom queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md).
- Create [custom alerts](../../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md) by using Azure Log Analytics workspace. 
- Take advantage of the [flexible retention period](../../../azure-monitor/logs/data-retention-archive.md) in Azure Monitor Logs/Log Analytics. 
- Connect monitoring data with your ticketing system.

## What data is collected?

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't collect Azure Monitor metrics or resource log data, like some other Azure resources do. Instead, Azure Monitor for SAP solutions sends custom logs directly to the Azure Monitor Logs system. There, you can then use the built-in features of Log Analytics.

Data collection in Azure Monitor for SAP solutions depends on the providers that you configure. During public preview, the following data is collected.

## What is the architecture?

There are separate explanations for the [Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture](#azure-monitor-for-sap-solutions-architecture) and the [Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) architecture](#azure-monitor-for-sap-solutions-classic-architecture).

Some important points about the architecture include: 

- The architecture is **multi-instance**. You can monitor multiple instances of a given component type across multiple SAP systems (SID) within a virtual network with a single resource of Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. For example, you can monitor HANA databases, high availability (HA) clusters, Microsoft SQL server, SAP NetWeaver, etc.
- The architecture is **multi-provider**. The architecture diagram shows the SAP HANA provider as an example. Similarly, you can configure more providers for corresponding components to collect data from those components. For example, HANA DB, HA cluster, Microsoft SQL server, and SAP NetWeaver. 
- The architecture has an **extensible query framework**. Write [SQL queries to collect data in JSON](https://github.com/Azure/AzureMonitorForSAPSolutions/blob/master/sapmon/content/SapHana.json). Easily add more SQL queries to collect other data. 


### Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture 

The following diagram shows, at a high level, how Azure Monitor for SAP solutions collects data from the SAP HANA database. The architecture is the same if SAP HANA is deployed on Azure VMs or Azure Large Instances.

:::image type="complex" source="./media/azure-monitor-sap/azure-monitor-sap-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the new Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture.":::
   Diagram of the new Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture. The customer connects to the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource through the Azure portal. There's a managed resource group containing Log Analytics, Azure Functions, Key Vault, and Storage queue. The Azure function connects to the providers. Providers include SAP NetWeaver (ABAP and JAVA), SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM Db2, Pacemaker clusters, and Linux OS.
:::image-end:::

The key components of the architecture are:

- The **Azure portal**, where you access the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions service.
- The **Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource**, where you view monitoring data.
- The **managed resource group**, which is deployed automatically as part of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource's deployment. The resources inside the managed resource group help to collect data. Key resources include:
   - An **Azure Functions resource** that hosts the monitoring code. This logic collects data from the source systems and transfers the data to the monitoring framework. 
   - An **[Azure Key Vault resource](../../../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md)**, which securely holds the SAP HANA database credentials and stores information about providers.
   - The **Log Analytics workspace**, which is the destination for storing data. Optionally, you can choose to use an existing workspace in the same subscription as your Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource at deployment.
   
[Azure Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) provides customizable visualization of the data in Log Analytics. To automatically refresh your workbooks or visualizations, pin the items to the Azure dashboard. The maximum refresh frequency is every 30 minutes.
   
You can also use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to [run log queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) against the raw tables inside the Log Analytics workspace. 

### Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) architecture

The following diagram shows, at a high level, how Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) collects data from the SAP HANA database. The architecture is the same if SAP HANA is deployed on Azure VMs or Azure Large Instances.

:::image type="complex" source="./media/azure-monitor-sap/azure-monitor-sap-classic-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions classic architecture.":::
   Diagram of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) architecture. The customer connects to the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource through the Azure portal. There's a managed resource group containing Log Analytics, Azure Functions, Key Vault, and Storage queue. The Azure function connects to the providers. Providers include SAP NetWeaver (ABAP and JAVA), SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, Pacemaker clusters, and Linux OS.
:::image-end:::

The key components of the architecture are:

- The **Azure portal**, which is your starting point. You can navigate to marketplace within the Azure portal and discover Azure Monitor for SAP solutions.
- The **Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource**, which is the landing place for you to view monitoring data.
- **Managed resource group**, which is deployed automatically as part of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource's deployment. The resources deployed within the managed resource group help with the collection of data. Key resources deployed and their purposes are:
   - **Azure VM**, also known as the *collector VM*, which is a **Standard_B2ms** VM. The main purpose of this VM is to host the *monitoring payload*. The monitoring payload is the logic of collecting data from the source systems and transferring the data to the monitoring framework. In the architecture diagram, the monitoring payload contains the logic to connect to the SAP HANA database over the SQL port. You're responsible for patching and maintaining the VM.
   - **[Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md)**: which is deployed to securely hold SAP HANA database credentials and to store information about providers.
   - **Log Analytics Workspace**, which is the destination where the data is stored.
      - Visualization is built on top of data in Log Analytics using [Azure Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). You can customize visualization. You can also pin your Workbooks or specific visualization within Workbooks to Azure dashboard for auto-refresh. The maximum frequency for refresh is every 30 minutes.
      - You can use your existing workspace within the same subscription as SAP monitor resource by choosing this option at deployment.
      - You can use KQL to run [queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) against the raw tables inside the Log Analytics workspace. Look at **Custom Logs**.
      - You can use an existing Log Analytics workspace for data collection if it's deployed within the same Azure subscription as the resource for Azure Monitor for SAP solutions.

## Can you analyze metrics?

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't support metrics. 

### Analyze logs

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't support resource logs or activity logs. For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs that can be queried by Log Analytics, see [the data reference for monitoring SAP on Azure](monitor-sap-on-azure-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables). 

### Make Kusto queries

When you select **Logs** from the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. Log queries only include data from that resource. To run a query that includes data from other accounts or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. For more information, see [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

You can use Kusto queries to help you monitor your Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resources. The following sample query gives you data from a custom log for a specified time range. You can specify the time range and the number of rows. In this example, you'll get five rows of data for your selected time range. 

```kusto
custom log name 
| take 5
```

## How do you get alerts?

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. You can then identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them.

You can configure alerts in Azure Monitor for SAP solutions from the Azure portal. For more information, see [how to configure alerts in Azure Monitor for SAP solutions with the Azure portal](azure-monitor-alerts-portal.md).
