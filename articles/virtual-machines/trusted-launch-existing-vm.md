# Enable Trusted launch on existing Azure VMs

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VM :heavy_check_mark: Windows VM :heavy_check_mark: Generation 2 VM

Azure Virtual Machines supports enabling Azure Trusted launch on existing [Azure Generation 2](generation-2.md) virtual machines (VMs) by upgrading to the [Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md) security type.

[Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md) is a way to enable foundational compute security on [Azure Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) and protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques like boot kits and rootkits. It does so by combining infrastructure technologies like Secure Boot, virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM), and boot integrity monitoring on your VM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for *enabling Trusted launch on existing Azure Generation 1 VMs* is currently in private preview. You can gain access to preview by using the [registration form](https://aka.ms/Gen1ToTLUpgrade).

## Prerequisites

- Azure Generation 2 VM is configured with:
  - [Trusted launch supported size family](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes).
  - [Trusted launch supported operating system (OS) image](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported). For custom OS images or disks, the base image should be *Trusted launch capable*.
- Azure Generation 2 VM isn't using [features currently not supported with Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#unsupported-features).
- Azure Generation 2 VMs should be *stopped and deallocated* before you enable the Trusted launch security type.
- Azure Backup, if enabled, for VMs should be configured with the [Enhanced Backup policy](../backup/backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy.md). The Trusted launch security type can't be enabled for Generation 2 VMs configured with *Standard policy* backup protection.
  - Existing Azure VM backup can be migrated from the *Standard* to the *Enhanced* policy. Follow the steps in [Migrate Azure VM backups from Standard to Enhanced policy (preview)](../backup/backup-azure-vm-migrate-enhanced-policy.md).

## Best practices

- Enable Trusted launch on a test Generation 2 VM and determine if any changes are required to meet the prerequisites before you enable Trusted launch on Generation 2 VMs associated with production workloads.
- [Create restore points](create-restore-points.md) for Azure Generation 2 VMs associated with production workloads before you enable the Trusted launch security type. You can use the restore points to re-create the disks and Generation 2 VM with the previous well-known state.

## Enable Trusted launch on an existing VM

> [!NOTE]
>
> - After you enable Trusted launch, currently VMs can't be rolled back to the Standard security type (non-Trusted launch configuration).
> - vTPM is enabled by default.
> - We recommend that you enable Secure Boot, if you aren't using custom unsigned kernel or drivers. It's not enabled by default. Secure Boot preserves boot integrity and enables foundational security for VMs.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Enable Trusted launch on an existing Azure Generation 2 VM by using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Confirm that the VM generation is **V2** and select **Stop** for the VM.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trusted-launch/02-generation-2-to-trusted-launch-stop-vm.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Gen2 VM to be deallocated.":::

1. On the **Overview** page in the VM properties, under **Security type**, select **Standard**. The **Configuration** page for the VM opens.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trusted-launch/03-generation-2-to-trusted-launch-click-standard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Security type as Standard.":::

1. On the **Configuration** page, under the **Security type** section, select the **Security type** dropdown list.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trusted-launch/04-generation-2-to-trusted-launch-select-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Security type dropdown list.":::

1. Under the dropdown list, select **Trusted launch**. Select checkboxes to enable **Secure Boot** and **vTPM**. After you make the changes, select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Generation 2 VMs created by using [Azure Compute Gallery (ACG)](azure-compute-gallery.md), [Managed image](capture-image-resource.yml), or an [OS disk](./scripts/create-vm-from-managed-os-disks.md) can't be upgraded to Trusted launch by using the portal. Ensure that the [OS version is supported for Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md#operating-systems-supported). Use PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to run the upgrade.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trusted-launch/05-generation-2-to-trusted-launch-select-uefi-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Secure Boot and vTPM settings.":::

1. After the update successfully finishes, close the **Configuration** page. On the **Overview** page in the VM properties, confirm the **Security type** settings.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/trusted-launch/06-generation-2-to-trusted-launch-validate-uefi.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Trusted launch upgraded VM.":::

1. Start the upgraded Trusted launch VM. Verify that you can sign in to the VM by using either the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for Windows VMs or the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) for Linux VMs.

## Azure Advisor Recommendation

Azure Advisor populates an **Enable Trusted launch foundational excellence, and modern security for Existing Generation 2 VM(s)** operational excellence recommendation for existing Generation 2 VMs to adopt [Trusted launch](trusted-launch.md), a higher security posture for Azure VMs at no additional cost to you. Ensure Generation 2 VM has all prerequisites to migrate to Trusted launch, follow all the best practices including validation of OS image, VM Size, and creating restore points. For the Advisor recommendation to be considered complete, follow the steps outlined in the [**Enable Trusted launch on an existing VM**](trusted-launch-existing-vm.md#enable-trusted-launch-on-an-existing-vm) to upgrade the virtual machines security type and enable Trusted launch.

**What if there is Generation 2 VMs, that doesn't fit the prerequisites for Trusted launch?**

For a Generation 2 VM, that has not met the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) to upgrade to Trusted launch, look how to fulfill the prerequisites. For example, If using a virtual machine size not supported, please look for an [equivalent Trusted launch supported size](trusted-launch.md#virtual-machines-sizes) that supports Trusted launch.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Please dismiss the recommendation if Gen2 virtual machine is configured with VM size families which are currently not supported with Trusted launch like MSv2-series.
