  Restrict import/export access for managed disks using Azure Private Link
introduction: |
  **Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

  You can use [private endpoints](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) to restrict the export and import of managed disks and more securely access data over a [private link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) from clients on your Azure virtual network. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the virtual network address space for your managed disks. Network traffic between clients on their virtual network and managed disks only traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.

  To use Private Link to export and import managed disks, first you create a disk access resource and link it to a virtual network in the same subscription by creating a private endpoint. Then, associate a disk or a snapshot with a disk access instance.

      ## Create a disk access resource
    steps:
      - |   
        Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Disk Accesses**.
      - |   
        Select **+ Create** to create a new disk access resource.
      - |   
        On the **Create a disk accesses** pane, select your subscription and a resource group. Under **Instance details**, enter a name and select a region.

      - |
        Select **Review + create**.
      - |
        When your resource has been created, navigate directly to it.

      Create a private endpoint
    summary: |
      Next, you'll need to create a private endpoint and configure it for disk access.
    steps:
      - | 
        From your disk access resource, under **Settings**, select **Private endpoint connections**.
      - |
        Select **+ Private endpoint**.

      - |
        In the **Create a private endpoint** pane, select a resource group.
      - |  
        Provide a name and select the same region in which your disk access resource was created.

If you do not select the appropriate region then you may encounter issues later on.":::
      - |
        Select **Next: Resource**.
      - |  
        On the **Resource** pane, select **Connect to an Azure resource in my directory**.
      - |
        For **Resource type**, select **Microsoft.Compute/diskAccesses**.
      - |
        For **Resource**, select the disk access resource you created earlier.
      - |  
        Leave the **Target sub-resource** as **disks**.

With all the values highlighted (Resource type, Resource, Target sub-resource).":::
      - |
        Select **Next : Configuration**.
      - |  
        Select the virtual network to which you will limit disk import and export. This prevents the import and export of your disk to other virtual networks.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you have a network security group enabled for the selected subnet, it will be disabled for private endpoints on this subnet only. Other resources on this subnet will retain network security group enforcement.
      - |
        Select the appropriate subnet.

        Select **Review + create**.

      Enable private endpoint on your disk
    summary: |
      Follow these steps:
    steps:   
      - |
        Navigate to the disk you'd like to configure.
      - |  
        Under **Settings**, select **Networking**.
      - |  
        Select **Private endpoint (through disk access)** and select the disk access you created earlier.

Highlighting the private endpoint selection as well as the selected disk access. Saving this configures your disk for this access.":::
      - |
        Select **Save**.

        You've now configured a private link that you can use to import and export your managed disk. You can import using the [Azure CLI](linux/disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-cli.md) or the [Azure PowerShell module](windows/disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-powershell.md). You can export either [Windows](windows/download-vhd.md) or [Linux](linux/download-vhd.md) VHDs.
