Hibernation allows you to pause VMs that aren't being used and save on compute costs. It's an effective cost management feature for scenarios such as:
- Virtual desktops, dev/test servers, and other scenarios where the VMs don't need to run 24/7.
- Systems with long boot times due to memory intensive applications. These applications can be initialized on VMs and hibernated. These “prewarmed” VMs can then be quickly started when needed, with the applications already up and running in the desired state.
