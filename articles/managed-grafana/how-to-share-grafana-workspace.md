# How to share an Azure Managed Grafana Preview instance

A DevOps team may build dashboards to monitor and diagnose an application or infrastructure that it manages. Likewise, a support team may use a Grafana monitoring solution for troubleshooting customer issues. In these scenarios, multiple users will be accessing one Grafana instance. Azure Managed Grafana enables such sharing by allowing you to set the custom permissions on an instance that you own. This article explains what permissions are supported and how to grant permissions to share dashboards with your internal teams or external customers.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet).
- An Azure Managed Grafana instance. If you don't have one yet, [create a Managed Grafana instance](./how-to-permissions.md).

## Supported Grafana roles

Azure Managed Grafana supports the Admin, Viewer and Editor roles:

- The Admin role provides full control of the instance including viewing, editing, and configuring data sources.
- The Editor role provides read-write access to the dashboards in the instance.
- The Viewer role provides read-only access to dashboards in the instance.

The Admin role is automatically assigned to the creator of a Grafana instance. More details on Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles can be found at [Grafana organization roles](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/organization_roles/#compare-roles).

Grafana user roles and assignments are fully integrated with the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can add any Azure AD user or security group to a Grafana role and grant them access permissions associated with that role. You can manage these permissions from the Azure portal or the command line. This section explains how to assign users to the Viewer or Editor role in the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Managed Grafana doesn't support personal [Microsoft accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) (a.k.a., MSA) currently.
