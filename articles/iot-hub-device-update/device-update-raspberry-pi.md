# Tutorial: Device Update for Azure IoT Hub using the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ reference image

Device Update for Azure IoT Hub supports image-based, package-based, and script-based updates.

Image updates provide a higher level of confidence in the end state of the device. It's typically easier to replicate the results of an image update between a preproduction environment and a production environment because it doesn't pose the same challenges as packages and their dependencies. Because of their atomic nature, you can also adopt an A/B failover model easily.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to complete an end-to-end image-based update by using Device Update for IoT Hub on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ board.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download an image.
> * Add a tag to your IoT device.
> * Import an update.
> * Create a device group.
> * Deploy an image update.
> * Monitor the update deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> Image updates in this tutorial were validated on the Raspberry Pi B3 board.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already done so, create a [Device Update account and instance](create-device-update-account.md) and configure an IoT hub.

## Download the image

We provide sample images in **Assets** on the [Device Update GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases). The .gz file is the base image that you can flash on to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ board. The swUpdate file is the update you would import through Device Update for IoT Hub.

## Flash an SD card with the image

Use your favorite OS flashing tool to install the Device Update base image (adu-base-image) on the SD card that will be used in the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ device.

### Use bmaptool to flash the SD card

1. Install the `bmaptool` utility, if you haven't done so already.

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install bmap-tools
   ```

1. Locate the path for the SD card in `/dev`. The path should look something like `/dev/sd*` or `/dev/mmcblk*`. You can use the `dmesg` utility to help locate the correct path.
1. Unmount all mounted partitions before flashing.

   ```shell
   sudo umount /dev/<device>
   ```

1. Make sure you have write permissions to the device.

   ```shell
   sudo chmod a+rw /dev/<device>
   ```

1. Optional: For faster flashing, download the bimap file and the image file and put them in the same directory.
1. Flash the SD card.

   ```shell
   sudo bmaptool copy <path to image> /dev/<device>
   ```

Device Update for Azure IoT Hub software is subject to the following license terms:

   * [Device update for IoT Hub license](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/LICENSE)
   * [Delivery optimization client license](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/LICENSE)

Read the license terms prior to using the agent. Your installation and use constitutes your acceptance of these terms. If you don't agree with the license terms, don't use the Device Update for IoT Hub agent.

## Create a device or module in IoT Hub and get a connection string

Now, add the device to IoT Hub. From within IoT Hub, a connection string is generated for the device.

1. From the Azure portal, start IoT Hub.
1. Create a new device.
1. On the left pane, select **IoT Devices**. Then select **New**.
1. Under **Device ID**, enter a name for the device. Ensure that the **Autogenerate keys** checkbox is selected.
1. Select **Save**. On the **Devices** page, the device you created should be in the list.
1. Get the device connection string by using one of two options:

   - Option 1: Use the Device Update agent with a module identity: On the same **Devices** page, select **Add Module Identity** at the top. Create a new Device Update module with the name **IoTHubDeviceUpdate**. Choose other options as they apply to your use case and then select **Save**. Select the newly created module. In the module view, select the **Copy** icon next to **Primary Connection String**.
   - Option 2: Use the Device Update agent with the device identity: In the device view, select the **Copy** icon next to **Primary Connection String**.

1. Paste the copied characters somewhere for later use in the following steps:

   **This copied string is your device connection string**.

## Prepare on-device configurations for Device Update for IoT Hub

Two configuration files must be on the device so that Device Update for IoT Hub configures properly. The first file is the `du-config.json` file, which must exist at `/adu/du-config.json`. The second file is the `du-diagnostics-config.json` file, which must exist at `/adu/du-diagnostics-config.json`.

Here are two examples for the `du-config.json` and the `du-diagnostics-config.json` files:

### Example du-config.json

```JSON
   {
      "schemaVersion": "1.0",
      "aduShellTrustedUsers": [
         "adu",
         "do"
      ],
      "manufacturer": "fabrikam",
      "model": "vacuum",
      "agents": [
         {
         "name": "main",
         "runas": "adu",
         "connectionSource": {
            "connectionType": "string",
            "connectionData": "HostName=example-connection-string.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=example-device;SharedAccessKey=M5oK/rOP12aB5678YMWv5vFWHFGJFwE8YU6u0uTnrmU="
         },
         "manufacturer": "fabrikam",
         "model": "vacuum"
         }
      ]
   }  
```

### Example du-diagnostics-config.json

```JSON
   {
      "logComponents":[
         {
               "componentName":"adu",
               "logPath":"/adu/logs/"
         },
         {
               "componentName":"do",
               "logPath":"/var/log/deliveryoptimization-agent/"
         }
      ],
      "maxKilobytesToUploadPerLogPath":50
   }
```

## Configure the Device Update agent on Raspberry Pi

1. Make sure that Raspberry Pi 3 is connected to the network.
1. Follow these instructions to add the configuration details:

   1. First, SSH in to the machine by using the following command in the PowerShell window:
   
	   ```shell
	      ssh raspberrypi3 -l root
	   ```

   1. Create or open the `du-config.json` file for editing by using:
   
	   ```bash
	      nano /adu/du-config.json
	   ```

   1. After you run the command, you should see an open editor with the file. If you've never created the file, it will be empty. Now copy the preceding example du-config.json contents, and substitute the configurations required for your device. Then replace the example connection string with the one for the device you created in the preceding steps.
  
   1. After you finish your changes, select **Ctrl+X** to exit the editor. Then enter **y** to save the changes.
  
   1. Now you need to create the `du-diagnostics-config.json` file by using similar commands. Start by creating or opening the `du-diagnostics-config.json` file for editing by using:
   
	   ```bash
	      nano /adu/du-diagnostics-config.json
	   ```

   1. Copy the preceding example du-diagnostics-config.json contents, and substitute any configurations that differ from the default build. The example du-diagnostics-config.json file represents the default log locations for Device Update for IoT Hub. You only need to change these if your implementation differs.
   1. After you finish your changes, select **Ctrl+X** to exit the editor. Then enter **y** to save the changes.
   1. Use the following command to show the files located in the `/adu/` directory. You should see both of your configuration files.du-diagnostics-config.json files for editing by using:

	   ```bash
	      ls -la /adu/
	   ```

1. Restart the Device Update system daemon to make sure that the configurations were applied. Use the following command within the terminal logged in to the `raspberrypi`:
    
    ```markdown
       systemctl start adu-agent
    ```

1. Check that the agent is live by using the following command:
  
    ```markdown
       systemctl status adu-agent
    ```

   You should see the status come back as alive and green.

## Connect the device in Device Update for IoT Hub

1. On the left pane, select **IoT Devices**.
1. Select the link with your device name.
1. At the top of the page, select **Device Twin** if you're connecting directly to Device Update by using the IoT device identity. Otherwise, select the module you created and select its module twin.
1. Under the **reported** section of the **Device Twin** properties, look for the Linux kernel version.
For a new device, which hasn't received an update from Device Update, the
[DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation:1.swVersion](device-update-plug-and-play.md) value represents
the firmware version running on the device. After an update has been applied to a device, Device Update
uses the [AzureDeviceUpdateCore:ClientMetadata:4.installedUpdateId](device-update-plug-and-play.md) property
value to represent the firmware version running on the device.
1. The base and update image files have a version number in the file name.

   ```markdown
   adu-<image type>-image-<machine>-<version number>.<extension>
   ```

Use that version number in the later "Import the update" section.

## Add a tag to your device

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to the IoT hub.
1. On the left pane, under **IoT Devices** or **IoT Edge**, find your IoT device and go to the device twin or module twin.
1. In the module twin of the Device Update agent module, delete any existing Device Update tag values by setting them to null. If you're using the device identity with the Device Update agent, make these changes on the device twin.
1. Add a new Device Update tag value, as shown:
    
    ```JSON
        "tags": {
                "ADUGroup": "<CustomTagValue>"
                }
    ```

## Import the update

1. Download the sample tutorial manifest (Tutorial Import Manifest_Pi.json) and sample update (adu-update-image-raspberrypi3-0.6.5073.1.swu) from [Release Assets](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) for the latest agent.
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to your IoT hub with Device Update. On the left pane, under **Automatic Device Management**, select **Updates**.
1. Select the **Updates** tab.
1. Select **+ Import New Update**.
1. Select **+ Select from storage container**. Select an existing account or create a new account by using **+ Storage account**. Then select an existing container or create a new container by using **+ Container**. This container will be used to stage your update files for importing.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you use a new container each time you import an update to avoid accidentally importing files from previous updates. If you don't use a new container, be sure to delete any files from the existing container before you finish this step.
