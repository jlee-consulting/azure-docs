# Tutorial: Device Update for Azure IoT Hub using the Ubuntu (18.04 x64) simulator reference agent

Device Update for Azure IoT Hub supports image-based, package-based, and script-based updates.

Image updates provide a higher level of confidence in the end state of the device. It's typically easier to replicate the results of an image update between a preproduction environment and a production environment because it doesn't pose the same challenges as packages and their dependencies. Because of their atomic nature, you can also adopt an A/B failover model easily.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to complete an end-to-end image-based update by using Device Update for IoT Hub.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download and install an image.
> * Add a tag to your IoT device.
> * Import an update.
> * Create a device group.
> * Deploy an image update.
> * Monitor the update deployment.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already done so, create a [Device Update account and instance](create-device-update-account.md) and configure an IoT hub.

Download the zip file named `Tutorial_Simulator.zip` from [Release Assets](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/releases) in the latest release, and unzip it.

## Add a device to Azure IoT Hub

After the Device Update agent is running on an IoT device, you must add the device to IoT Hub. From within IoT Hub, a connection string is generated for a particular device.

1. From the Azure portal, start the Device Update for IoT Hub.
1. Create a new device.
1. On the left pane, go to **IoT Devices**. Then select **New**.
1. Under **Device ID**, enter a name for the device. Ensure that the **Autogenerate keys** checkbox is selected.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Now, you're returned to the **Devices** page and the device you created should be in the list. Select that device.
1. In the device view, select the **Copy** icon next to **Primary Connection String**.
1. Paste the copied characters somewhere for later use in the following steps:

    **This copied string is your device connection string**.

## Install a Device Update agent to test it as a simulator

1. Follow the instructions to [install the Azure IoT Edge runtime](../iot-edge/how-to-provision-single-device-linux-symmetric.md?view=iotedge-2020-11&preserve-view=true).
   > [!NOTE]
   > The Device Update agent doesn't depend on IoT Edge. But it does rely on the IoT Identity Service daemon that's installed with IoT Edge (1.2.0 and higher) to obtain an identity and connect to IoT Hub.
   >
   > Although not covered in this tutorial, the [IoT Identity Service daemon can be installed standalone on Linux-based IoT devices](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service/installation.html). The sequence of installation matters. The Device Update package agent must be installed _after_ the IoT Identity Service. Otherwise, the package agent won't be registered as an authorized component to establish a connection to IoT Hub.
1. Then, install the Device Update agent .deb packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install deviceupdate-agent deliveryoptimization-plugin-apt 
   ```

1. Enter your IoT device's module (or device, depending on how you [provisioned the device with Device Update](device-update-agent-provisioning.md)) primary connection string in the configuration file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/adu/du-config.json
   ```

1. Set up the agent to run as a simulator. Run the following command on the IoT device so that the Device Update agent invokes the simulator handler to process a package update with APT ('microsoft/apt:1'):

   ```sh
   sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register-content-handler /var/lib/adu/extensions/sources/libmicrosoft_simulator_1.so --update-type 'microsoft/apt:1'
   ```
   
   To register and invoke the simulator handler, use the following format, filling in the placeholders:
   
   `sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register--content-handler <full path to the handler file> --update-type <update type name>`

1. You will need the file `sample-du-simulator-data.json` from the downloaded `Tutorial_Simulator.zip` in the prerequisites. 

   Open the file `sample-du-simulator-data.json` and copy contents to clipboard:
   
   ```sh
   nano sample-du-simulator-data.json
   ```
   
   Select the contents of the file and press **Ctrl+C**. Press **Ctrl+X** to close the file and don't save changes.
   
   Run the following command to create and edit the `du-simulator-data.json` file in the tmp folder:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   ```
   Press **Ctrl+V** to paste the contents into the editor. Select **Ctrl+X** to save the changes, and then **Y**.
   
   Change permissions:
   ```sh
   sudo chown adu:adu /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   sudo chmod 664 /tmp/du-simulator-data.json
   ```
  
   If /tmp doesn't exist, then:

   ```sh
    sudo mkdir/tmp
    sudo chown root:root/tmp
    sudo chmod 1777/tmp
   ```  

1. Restart the Device Update agent by running the following command:

   ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart adu-agent
   ```

Device Update for Azure IoT Hub software is subject to the following license terms:

   * [Device Update for IoT Hub license](https://github.com/Azure/iot-hub-device-update/blob/main/LICENSE)
   * [Delivery optimization client license](https://github.com/microsoft/do-client/blob/main/LICENSE)

Read the license terms prior to using the agent. Your installation and use constitutes your acceptance of these terms. If you don't agree with the license terms, don't use the Device Update for IoT Hub agent.

> [!NOTE]
> After your testing with the simulator, run the following command to invoke the APT handler and [deploy over-the-air package updates](device-update-ubuntu-agent.md):
```sh
# sudo /usr/bin/AducIotAgent --register-content-handler /var/lib/adu/extensions/sources/libmicrosoft_apt_1.so --update-type 'microsoft/a pt:1'
```

## Add a tag to your device

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to the IoT hub.
1. From **IoT Devices** or **IoT Edge** on the left pane, find your IoT device and go to the device twin or module twin.
1. In the module twin of the Device Update agent module, delete any existing Device Update tag values by setting them to null. If you're using the device identity with a Device Update agent, make these changes on the device twin.
1. Add a new Device Update tag value, as shown:

   ```JSON
       "tags": {
               "ADUGroup": "<CustomTagValue>"
               }
   ```

## Import the update

1. You will need the files `TutorialImportManifest_Sim.importmanifest.json` and `adu-update-image-raspberrypi3.swu` from the downloaded `Tutorial_Simulator.zip` in the prerequisites. The update file is reused from the Raspberry Pi tutorial. Because the update in this tutorial is simulated, the specific file content doesn't matter.
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to your IoT hub with Device Update. On the left pane, under **Automatic Device Management**, select **Updates**.
1. Select the **Updates** tab.
1. Select **+ Import New Update**.
1. Select **+ Select from storage container**. Select an existing account or create a new account by using **+ Storage account**. Then select an existing container or create a new container by using **+ Container**. This container will be used to stage your update files for importing.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you use a new container each time you import an update to avoid accidentally importing files from previous updates. If you don't use a new container, be sure to delete any files from the existing container before you finish this step.
