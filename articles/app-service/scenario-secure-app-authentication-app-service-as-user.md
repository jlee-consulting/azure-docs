# Tutorial: Add user authentication to your web app running on Azure App Service

[!INCLUDE [start](./includes/tutorial-set-up-app-service-authentication/intro.md)]

## Connect to backend services as user

User authentication can begin with authenticating the user to your app service as described in the previous section.

Once the app service has the authenticated identity, your system needs to **connect to backend services as the user**:

* A database example is a SQL database which imposes its own security for that identity on tables
    
* A storage example is Blob Storage which imposes its own security for that identity on containers and blobs

* A user needs access to Microsoft Graph to access their own email.
