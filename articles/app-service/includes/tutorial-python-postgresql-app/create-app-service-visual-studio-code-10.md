View the output and browse to the website:

1. When a message appears indicating that the new App Service was created, select **View Output** to switch to the **Output** window in VS Code.

1. To confirm that the App Service is running properly, right-click the App Service name, and select **Browse Website**.

1. Because you haven't deployed your own code to the App Service yet (which you do in a later step), only a default app page appears.
