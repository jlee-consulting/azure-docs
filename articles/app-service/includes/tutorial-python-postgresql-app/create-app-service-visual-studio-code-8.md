Select the App Service plan pricing tier for this web app.
<br><br>
The App Service plan controls how many resources (CPU/memory) are available to your app and how much you pay. For this example, it's recommended to select the **Basic (B1) Develop and test** pricing tier. This will incur a small cost in your Azure subscription but provides better performance than the Free (F1) tier.
