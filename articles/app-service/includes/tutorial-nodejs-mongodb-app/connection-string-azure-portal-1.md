Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account. If you have just created your Azure Cosmos DB account, you can select the *Go to resource* button to be taken directly to the account. Or you can use the search box at the top of the screen to search for and navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB database.

1. On the page for your Azure Cosmos DB instance, make sure the Quick start item is selected in the left menu. You will see text box labeled **Primary Connection String**. While there are tabs for different languages, the connection string is the same regardless of language.
2. Copy the value of the connection string into your clipboard buffer.
