In your VS Code environment, verify that the Azure Account and Azure App Service extensions are installed.  Ensure you're logged into your Azure Account using the Account extension.
<br />
<br />
If you're not already logged in through the Azure Account extension, you use Ctrl + Shift + P to open the VS Code Command Palette.  From there you can type *Azure: Sign In* and then hit enter to launch a browser window to sign in.
