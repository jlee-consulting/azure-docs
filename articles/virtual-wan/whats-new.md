## Preview

The following features are currently in gated public preview. After working with the listed articles, you have questions or require support, reach out to the contact alias (if available) that corresponds to the feature.

|Type of preview|Feature |Description|Contact alias|Limitations|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Managed preview|Configure user groups and IP address pools for P2S User VPNs| This feature allows you to configure P2S User VPNs to assign users IP addresses from specific address pools based on their identity or authentication credentials by creating **User Groups**.|| Known limitations are displayed here: [Configure User Groups and IP address pools for P2S User VPNs (preview)](user-groups-create.md).|
|Managed preview|Aruba EdgeConnect SD-WAN| Deployment of Aruba EdgeConnect SD-WAN NVA into the Virtual WAN hub| preview-vwan-aruba@microsoft.com| |
|Managed preview|Routing intent and policies enabling inter-hub security|This feature allows you to configure internet-bound, private, or inter-hub traffic flow through the Azure Firewall. For more information, see [Routing intent and policies](how-to-routing-policies.md).|For access to the preview, contact previewinterhub@microsoft.com|Not compatible with NVA in a spoke, but compatible with BGP peering.<br><br>For additional limitations, see [How to configure Virtual WAN  hub routing intent and routing policies](how-to-routing-policies.md#key-considerations).|
|Managed preview|Checkpoint NGFW|Deployment of Checkpoint NGFW NVA into the Virtual WAN hub|DL-vwan-support-preview@checkpoint.com, previewinterhub@microsoft.com|Same limitations as routing intent.<br><br>Doesn't support internet inbound scenario.|
|Managed preview|Fortinet NGFW/SD-WAN|Deployment of Fortinet dual-role SD-WAN/NGFW NVA into the Virtual WAN hub|azurevwan@fortinet.com, previewinterhub@microsoft.com|Same limitations as routing intent.<br><br>Doesn't support internet inbound scenario.|
|Public preview/Self serve|Virtual hub routing preference|This feature allows you to influence routing decisions for the virtual hub router. For more information, see [Virtual hub routing preference](about-virtual-hub-routing-preference.md).|For questions or feedback, contact preview-vwan-hrp@microsoft.com|If a route-prefix is reachable via ER or VPN connections, and via virtual hub SD-WAN NVA, then the latter route is ignored by the route-selection algorithm. Therefore, the flows to prefixes reachable only via virtual hub. SD-WAN NVA will take the route through the NVA. This is a limitation during the preview phase of the hub routing preference feature.|
|Public preview/Self serve|Hub-to-hub traffic flows instead of an ER circuit connected to different hubs (Hub-to-hub over ER)|This feature allows traffic between 2 hubs traverse through the Azure Virtual WAN router in each hub and uses a hub-to-hub path, instead of the ExpressRoute path (which traverses through the Microsoft edge routers/MSEE). For more information, see the [Hub-to-hub over ER](virtual-wan-faq.md#expressroute-bow-tie) preview link.|For questions or feedback, contact preview-vwan-hrp@microsoft.com|

## Known issues

|#|Issue|Description |Date first reported|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Virtual hub router upgrade: Compatibility with NVA in a hub.|For deployments with an NVA provisioned in the hub, the virtual hub router can't be upgraded to VMSS.| July 2022|The Virtual WAN team is working on a fix that will allow Virtual hub routers to be upgraded to VMSS, even if an NVA is provisioned in the hub. After upgrading, users will have to re-peer the NVA with the hub router’s new IP addresses (instead of having to delete the NVA).|
|2|Virtual hub router upgrade: Compatibility with NVA in a spoke VNet.|For deployments with an NVA provisioned in a spoke VNet, the customer will have to delete and recreate the BGP peering with the spoke NVA.|March 2022|The Virtual WAN team is working on a fix to remove the need for users to delete and recreate the BGP peering with a spoke NVA after upgrading.|
|3|Virtual hub router upgrade: More than 100 Spoke VNets connected to the Virtual hub.|If there are more than 100 spoke VNets connected to the virtual hub, then the virtual hub router can't be upgraded.|September 2022|The Virtual WAN team is working on removing this limitation of 100 spoke VNets connected to the virtual hub during the router upgrade.|
