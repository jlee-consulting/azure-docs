# Azure security baseline for Virtual WAN

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Microsoft Azure Virtual
WAN. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Virtual
WAN. **Controls** not applicable to Virtual
WAN have been excluded.

To see how Virtual
WAN completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Virtual
WAN security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-1: Implement security for internal traffic

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN does not support deploying directly into a virtual network. However, you can still apply network security group rules on spoke resources, use Azure Firewall's protections or create custom route-tables to prevent or allow private traffic.

- [Custom routing scenarios](scenario-any-to-any.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-2: Connect private networks together 

**Guidance**: Use Azure ExpressRoute or Azure virtual private network (VPN) to create private connections between Azure datacenters and on-premises infrastructure in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public internet, offer more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections. 

For point-to-site VPN and site-to-site VPN, connect on-premises devices or networks to a virtual network using any combination of these VPN options and ExpressRoute. To connect two or more virtual networks in Azure together, use Virtual Network peering. Network traffic between peered virtual networks is private and is kept on the Azure backbone network.

- [Point to Site VPN overview](virtual-wan-point-to-site-portal.md)

- [Private Link](howto-private-link.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Shared

### NS-3: Establish private network access to Azure services

**Guidance**: Use Azure Private Link to enable private access to Azure Virtual WAN from your virtual networks without crossing the internet. Private access is another defense-in-depth measure in addition to authentication and traffic security offered by Azure services.

### NS-4: Protect applications and services from external network attacks

**Guidance**: Protect your Azure Virtual WAN resources against attacks from external networks, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, application-specific attacks, and unsolicited and potentially malicious internet traffic. 

Use Azure Firewall to protect applications and services against potentially malicious traffic from the internet and other external locations. Choose Azure DDoS Protection for your assets against attacks on your Azure virtual networks. Use Azure Security Center to detect misconfiguration risks related to your network-related resources.

- [Azure Security Center recommendations](../security-center/recommendations-reference.md#recs-network)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### NS-5: Deploy intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

**Guidance**: The best way of deploying intrusion detection or prevention systems in Azure Virtual WAN is using a Network Virtual Appliance in the spoke networks attached to the virtual hub.  More information is available on the routing scenarios at the referenced links. 

- [Scenario - Route traffic through an NVA](scenario-route-through-nva.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-6: Simplify network security rules

**Guidance**: Use Azure Virtual Network service tags to define network access controls on Azure network security groups or Azure Firewall configured for your Virtual WAN resources. 

Use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (for example: {VirtualWAN: Virtual Network}) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### NS-7: Secure Domain Name Service (DNS)

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN offers Custom DNS servers for Point-to-Site VPN Gateways. 

Follow the best practices for DNS security to mitigate against common attacks like dangling DNS, DNS amplifications attacks, DNS poisoning and spoofing, and so on.

When Azure DNS is used as your authoritative DNS service, ensure DNS zones and records are protected from accidental or malicious modification using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and resource locks.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN's Point-to-Site VPN is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which is Azure's default identity and access management service. You should standardize Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management in:

- Microsoft Cloud resources, such as the Azure portal, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machines (Linux and Windows), Azure Key Vault, PaaS, and SaaS applications.
- Your organization's resources, such as applications on Azure or your corporate network resources.

Secure Azure AD with high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Assess your identity and security posture with Azure Security Center's security score feature to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations. Implement Microsoft’s best practice recommendations for improvements to your security posture.

Azure AD also supports external identities, which allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity. Review information on using Azure AD in Point-to-Site VPN scenarios at the referenced links.

- [Use external identity providers for application](/azure/active-directory/b2b/identity-providers)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN's Point-to-Site VPN is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which supports strong authentication controls with multifactor authentication, and strong passwordless methods.

- Multifactor authentication - Enable Azure AD multifactor authentication and follow Azure Security Center's Identity and Access Management recommendations for best practices for your multifactor authentication setup. Multifactor authentication can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign in conditions and risk factors.

- Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available. These include, Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method are used, followed by a roll out of the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

- [How to enable MFA in P2S VPN for Virtual WAN](openvpn-azure-ad-mfa.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### IM-6: Restrict Azure resource access based on conditions

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN's Point-to-Site VPN supports Azure AD conditional access for a more granular access control based on user-defined conditions. For example, user logins from certain IP ranges have to use multifactor authentication for logging in. Granular authentication session management policy can also be used for different use cases.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-2: Restrict administrative access to business-critical systems

**Guidance**: Azure Virtual WAN uses Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) to isolate access to business-critical systems by restricting which accounts are granted privileged access to the subscriptions and management groups they are in.

Also restrict access to the management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business critical access such as Active Directory Domain Controllers, security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.

All types of access controls should be aligned to your enterprise segmentation strategy to ensure consistent access control.

- [Azure subscription administrators](../cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers, and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations or Azure Bastion for administrative tasks. Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), or Microsoft Intune to deploy a secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and network access.

## Data Protection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Data Protection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-data-protection).*

### DP-4: Encrypt sensitive information in transit

**Guidance**: Encryption is critical for traffic on external and public networks.

- Use access controls, data-in-transit should be protected against ‘out of band’ attacks (for example traffic capture) using encryption to ensure that attackers cannot easily read or modify the data.

- Ensure for HTTP traffic, that any clients connecting to your Azure resources can negotiate TLS v1.2 or greater.-

- For remote management, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of unencrypted protocol. Obsoleted SSL/TLS/SSH versions, protocols, and weak ciphers should be disabled.-

- At the underlying infrastructure, Azure provides data in transit encryption by default for data traffic between Azure datacenters.

In general, we provide encryption on the secure Microsoft backbone and opportunities to encrypt traffic in your Site-to-site VPN, Site-to-site VPN over Azure ExpressRoute and Point-to-site User VPN.

## Asset Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Asset Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-asset-management).*

### AM-2: Ensure security team has access to asset inventory and metadata

**Guidance**: Apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production.

Azure Virtual WAN also supports Azure Resource Manager based resource deployments and Azure Resource Graph queries.

## Logging and Threat Detection

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Logging and Threat Detection](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-protection).*

### LT-2: Enable threat detection for Azure identity and access management

**Guidance**: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides the following user logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, SIEM or monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases. These are:

- Sign in – The sign in report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign in activities.
- Audit logs - Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD, such as, adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
- Risky sign in - A risky sign in is an indicator for a sign in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
- Users flagged for risk - A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Use Azure Security Center to create alerts on certain suspicious activities such as excessive number of failed authentication attempts including deprecated accounts in the subscription. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, use Security Center’s Threat Protection module to collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you have visibility on account anomalies inside the individual resources.

- [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md) 

- [Enable Azure Identity Protection](../active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### LT-3: Enable logging for Azure network activities

**Guidance**: Use VPN packet capture tools to record network packets traveling between your Azure Virtual WAN resources. This could assist with the debugging process related to your hybrid network. While you cannot deploy a network security group on  Virtual WAN, you can deploy it onto your spoke virtual network resources.

Enable network security group flow logs on your network security groups for traffic auditing.

Enable Azure Traffic Analytics feature to process flow logs which are retained in storage account, and then send them to a Log Analytics workspace. Traffic Analytics provides additional insights into traffic flow for your Azure networks. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

- [How to enable network security group flow logs](../network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal.md) 

- [How to enable and use Traffic Analytics](../network-watcher/traffic-analytics.md) 

Virtual Wan does not produce or process DNS query logs which would need to be enabled.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### LT-4: Enable logging for Azure resources

**Guidance**: Azure Activity logs, enabled automatically, contain all write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) for your Azure Virtual WAN resources except read (GET) operations. Activity logs can be used to find an error during troubleshooting or to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource. However, Virtual WAN does not produce Azure resource logs.

- [Understand logging and different log types in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview.md)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Shared

### LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis

**Guidance**: Centralize logging storage and analysis to enable correlation. For each log source, ensure you have assigned a data owner, access guidance, storage location, what tools are used to process and access the data, and data retention requirements. Ensure you are integrating Azure Activity logs into your central logging systems. 

Ingest logs via Azure Monitor to aggregate security data generated by endpoint devices, network resources, and other security systems. In Azure Monitor, use Log Analytics workspaces to query and perform analytics, and use Azure storage accounts for long term and archival storage. In addition, enable and onboard data to Azure Sentinel or a third-party SIEM.

Many organizations choose to use Azure Sentinel for “hot” data that is used frequently and Azure Storage for “cold” data that is used less frequently.
