# Monitoring Virtual WAN - Data reference

This article provides a reference of log and metric data collected to analyze the performance and availability of Virtual WAN. See [Monitoring Virtual WAN](monitor-virtual-wan.md) for instructions and additional context on monitoring data for Virtual WAN.

## <a name="metrics"></a>Metrics

### <a name="hub-router-metrics"></a>Virtual hub router metrics  

The following metric is available for virtual hub router within a virtual hub:

| Metric | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **Virtual Hub Data Processed** | Data on how much traffic traverses the virtual hub router in a given time period. Only the following flows use the virtual hub router: VNet to VNet (same hub and interhub) and VPN/ExpressRoute branch to VNet (interhub). If a virtual hub is secured with routing intent, then these flows traverse the firewall instead of the hub router. |
| **Routing Infrastructure Units** | The virtual hub's routing infrastructure units (RIU). The virtual hub's RIU determines how much bandwidth the virtual hub router can process for flows traversing the virtual hub router. The hub's RIU also determines how many VMs in spoke VNets the virtual hub router can support. For more details on routing infrastructure units, see [Virtual Hub Capacity](hub-settings.md#capacity).
| **Spoke VM Utilization** | The approximate number of deployed spoke VMs as a percentage of the total number of spoke VMs that the hub's routing infrastructure units can support. For example, if the hub's RIU is set to 2 (which supports 2000 spoke VMs), and 1000 VMs are deployed across spoke VNets, then this metric's value will be approximately 50%.  |


### <a name="s2s-metrics"></a>Site-to-site VPN gateway metrics

| **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** | Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, and additional diagnostics.|
| **Tunnel Diagnostic Logs** | These are IPsec tunnel-related logs such as connect and disconnect events for a site-to-site IPsec tunnel, negotiated SAs, disconnect reasons, and additional diagnostics.

### ExpressRoute gateway diagnostics

In Azure Virtual WAN, ExpressRoute gateway metrics can be exported as logs via a diagnostic setting.

### Log Analytics sample query

If you selected to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics Workspace, then you can use SQL-like queries, such as the following example, to examine the data. For more information, see [Log Analytics Query Language](/services-hub/health/log-analytics-query-language).

The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"`

Replace the following values, after the **= =**, as needed based on the tables reported in the previous section of this article.

* "GatewayDiagnosticLog"
* "IKEDiagnosticLog"
* "P2SDiagnosticLog‚Äù
* "TunnelDiagnosticLog"
* "RouteDiagnosticLog"

In order to execute the query, you have to open the Log Analytics resource you configured to receive the diagnostic logs, and then select **Logs** under the **General** tab on the left side of the pane:

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/log-analytics-query-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Log Analytics Query samples." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/log-analytics-query-samples.png":::

For Azure Firewall, a [workbook](../firewall/firewall-workbook.md) is provided to make log analysis easier. Using its graphical interface, you can investigate the diagnostic data without manually writing any Log Analytics query.

## <a name="activity-logs"></a>Activity logs

[**Activity log**](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) entries are collected by default and can be viewed in the Azure portal. You can use Azure activity logs (formerly known as *operational logs* and *audit logs*) to view all operations submitted to your Azure subscription.

You can view activity logs independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

For more information on the schema of Activity Log entries, see [Activity Log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema.md).

## <a name="schemas"></a>Schemas

For detailed description of the top-level diagnostic logs schema, see [Supported services, schemas, and categories for Azure Diagnostic Logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

When reviewing any metrics through Log Analytics, the output contains the following columns:

|**Column**|**Type**|**Description**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|TimeGrain|string|PT1M (metric values are pushed every minute)|
|Count|real|Usually equal to 2 (each MSEE pushes a single metric value every minute)|
|Minimum|real|The minimum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs|
|Maximum|real|The maximum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs|
|Average|real|Equal to (Minimum + Maximum)/2|
|Total|real|Sum of the two metric values from both MSEEs (the main value to focus on for the metric queried)|

## <a name="azure-firewall"></a>Monitoring secured hub (Azure Firewall)

If you chose to secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall, relevant logs and metrics are available here: [Azure Firewall logs and metrics](../firewall/logs-and-metrics.md).
You can monitor the Secured Hub using Azure Firewall logs and metrics. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources.
For every Azure Virtual WAN you secure and convert to a Secured Hub, an explicit firewall resource object is created in the resource group where the hub is located.
