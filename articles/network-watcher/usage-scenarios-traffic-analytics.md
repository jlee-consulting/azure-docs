# Usage scenarios of traffic analytics

In this article, you learn how to get insights about your traffic after configuring traffic analytics in different scenarios.

## Find traffic hotspots

**Look for**

- Which hosts, subnets, virtual networks, and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic, traversing maximum malicious traffic and blocking significant flows?
    - Check comparative chart for hosts, subnet, virtual network, and virtual machine scale set. Understanding, which hosts, subnets, virtual networks and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic can help you identify the hosts that are processing the most traffic, and whether the traffic distribution is done properly.
    - You can evaluate if the volume of traffic is appropriate for a host. Is the volume of traffic normal behavior, or does it merit further investigation?
- How much inbound/outbound traffic is there?
    -   Is the host expected to receive more inbound traffic than outbound, or vice-versa?
- Statistics of blocked traffic.
    - Why is a host blocking a significant volume of benign traffic? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration
- Statistics of malicious allowed/blocked traffic
  - Why is a host receiving malicious traffic and why are flows from malicious sources allowed? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration.

    The following image shows time trending for the top five talking hosts and the flow-related details (allowed â€“ inbound/outbound and denied - inbound/outbound flows) for a host:

	Select **See more** under **Details of top 5 talking IPs'** as shown in the following image to get insights about all the hosts:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/traffic-analytics/top-five-most-talking-host-trend.png" alt-text="Screenshot of top five most-talking host trends.":::	

**Look for**

- Which are the most conversing host pairs?
    - Expected behavior like front-end or back-end communication or irregular behavior, like back-end internet traffic.
- Statistics of allowed/blocked traffic
    - Why a host is allowing or blocking significant traffic volume
- Most frequently used application protocol among most conversing host pairs:
    - Are these applications allowed on this network?
    - Are the applications configured properly? Are they using the appropriate protocol for communication? Select **See all** under **Frequent conversation**, as show in the following image:
