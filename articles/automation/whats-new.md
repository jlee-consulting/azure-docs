# What's new in Azure Automation?

Azure Automation receives improvements on an ongoing basis. To stay up to date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about:

- The latest releases
- Known issues
- Bug fixes

This page is updated monthly, so revisit it regularly. If you're looking for items older than six months, you can find them in [Archive for What's new in Azure Automation](whats-new-archive.md).

## August 2021

### Azure Policy Guest Configuration

**Type:** Plan for change

Customers should evaluate and plan for migration from Azure Automation State Configuration to Azure Policy guest configuration. For more information, see [Azure Policy guest configuration](../governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration.md).

## July 2021

### Preview support for user-assigned managed identity

**Type:** New feature

Azure Automation now supports [user-assigned Managed Identities](automation-secure-asset-encryption.md) for cloud jobs in Azure global, Azure Government, and Azure China regions. Read the [announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-automation-user-assigned-identities/) for more information.

### General Availability of customer-managed keys for Azure Automation

**Type:** New feature

Customers can manage and secure encryption of Azure Automation assets using their own managed keys. With the introduction of customer-managed keys you can supplement default encryption with an additional encryption layer using keys that you create and manage in Azure Key Vault. This additional encryption should help you meet your organization’s regulatory or compliance needs.

For more information, see [Use of customer-managed keys](automation-secure-asset-encryption.md#use-of-customer-managed-keys-for-an-automation-account).

## June 2021

### Security update for Log Analytics Contributor role

**Type:** Plan for change

Microsoft intends to remove the Automation account rights from the Log Analytics Contributor role. Currently, the built-in [Log Analytics Contributor](./automation-role-based-access-control.md#log-analytics-contributor) role can escalate privileges to the subscription [Contributor](./../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role. Since Automation account Run As accounts are initially configured with Contributor rights on the subscription, it can be used by an attacker to create new runbooks and execute code as a Contributor on the subscription.

As a result of this security risk, we recommend you don't use the Log Analytics Contributor role to execute Automation jobs. Instead, create the Azure Automation Contributor custom role and use it for actions related to the Automation account. For implementation steps, see [Custom Azure Automation Contributor role](./automation-role-based-access-control.md#custom-azure-automation-contributor-role).

### Support for Automation and State Configuration available in West US 3

### Start/Stop VMs during off-hours (v1)

**Type:** Plan for change

Start/Stop VMs during off-hours (v1) will deprecate on May 21, 2022. Customers should evaluate and plan for migration to the Start/Stop VMs v2 (preview). For more information, see [Start/Stop v2 overview](../azure-functions/start-stop-vms/overview.md) (preview).

## April 2021

### New scripts added for installing Hybrid worker on Windows and Linux

**Type:** New feature

Two new scripts have been added to the Azure Automation [GitHub repository](https://github.com/azureautomation) addressing one of Azure Automation's key scenarios of setting up a Hybrid Runbook Worker on either a Windows or a Linux machine. The script creates a new VM or uses an existing one, creates a Log Analytics workspace if needed, installs the Log Analytics agent for Windows or Log Analytics agent for Linux, and registers the machine to the Log Analytics workspace. The Windows script is named **Create Automation Windows HybridWorker** and the Linux script is **Create Automation Linux HybridWorker**.

### Invoke runbook through an Azure Resource Manager template webhook

See the [full list](./update-management/operating-system-requirements.md) of supported Linux operating systems for more details.

### In-region data residency support for Brazil South and South East Asia

**Type:** New feature

In all regions except Brazil South and Southeast Asia, Azure Automation data is stored in a different region (Azure paired region) for providing Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR). For the Brazil and Southeast Asia regions only, we now store Azure Automation data in the same region to accommodate data-residency requirements for these regions. For more information, see [Geo-replication in Azure Automation](./automation-managing-data.md#geo-replication-in-azure-automation).
