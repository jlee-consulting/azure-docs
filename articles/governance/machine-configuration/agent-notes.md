For information on release notes for the connected machine agent, please see [What's new with the connected machine agent](../../azure-arc/servers/agent-release-notes.md).

## Release notes

### Guest Configuration Linux Extension version 1.26.38

In this release, various improvements were made. 

- You can now restrict which URLs can be used to download machine configuration packages by setting the allowedGuestConfigPkgUrls tag on the server resource and providing a comma-separated list of URL patterns to allow. If the tag exists, the agent will only allow custom packages to be downloaded from the specified URLs. Built-in packages are unaffected by this feature. 

## Fixed

- Resolves local elevation of privilege vulnerability [CVE-2022-38007](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-38007). 
- If you're currently running an older version of the AzurePolicyforLinux extension, use the PowerShell or Azure CLI commands below to update your extension to the latest version. 

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -Publisher 'Microsoft.GuestConfiguration' -Type 'ConfigurationforLinux' -Name 'AzurePolicyforLinux' -TypeHandlerVersion 1.26.38 -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup' -Location 'myLocation' -VMName 'myVM' -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true
```

```azurecli
az vm extension set  --publisher Microsoft.GuestConfiguration --name ConfigurationforLinux --extension-instance-name AzurePolicyforLinux --resource-group myResourceGroup --vm-name myVM --version 1.26.38 --enable-auto-upgrade true
```
