# Understand guest configuration assignment resources

When an Azure Policy is assigned, if it's in the category "Guest Configuration"
there's metadata included to describe a guest assignment.

[A video walk-through of this document is available](https://youtu.be/DmCphySEB7A).

You can think of a guest assignment as a link between a machine and an Azure
Policy scenario. For example, the following snippet associates the Azure Windows
Baseline configuration with minimum version `1.0.0` to any machines in scope of
the policy.

```json
"metadata": {
    "category": "Guest Configuration",
    "guestConfiguration": {
        "name": "AzureWindowsBaseline",
        "version": "1.*"
    }
//additional metadata properties exist
```

## How Azure Policy uses guest configuration assignments

The metadata information is used by the guest configuration service to
automatically create an audit resource for definitions with either
**AuditIfNotExists** or **DeployIfNotExists** policy effects. The resource type
is `Microsoft.GuestConfiguration/guestConfigurationAssignments`. Azure Policy
uses the **complianceStatus** property of the guest assignment resource to
report compliance status. For more information, see
[getting compliance data](../how-to/get-compliance-data.md).

### Deletion of guest assignments from Azure Policy

When an Azure Policy assignment is deleted, if a guest configuration assignment
was created by the policy, the guest configuration assignment is also deleted.

## Manually creating guest configuration assignments

Guest assignment resources in Azure Resource Manager can be created by Azure
Policy or any client SDK.

An example deployment template:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "resources": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "2021-01-25",
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/providers/guestConfigurationAssignments",
      "name": "myMachine/Microsoft.GuestConfiguration/myConfig",
      "location": "westus2",
      "properties": {
        "guestConfiguration": {
          "name": "myConfig",
          "contentUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mystoragecontainer/myConfig.zip?sv=SASTOKEN",
          "contentHash": "SHA256HASH",
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "assignmentType": "ApplyAndMonitor",
          "configurationParameter": {}
        }
      }
    }    
  ]
}
```

The following table describes each property of guest assignment resources.

| Property | Description |
|-|-|
| name | Name of the configuration inside the content package MOF file. |
| contentUri | HTTPS URI path to the content package (.zip). |
| contentHash | A SHA256 hash value of the content package, used to verify it has not changed. |
| version | Version of the content package. Only used for built-in packages and not used for custom content packages. |
| assignmentType | Behavior of the assignment. Allowed values: `Audit`, `ApplyandMonitor`, and `ApplyandAutoCorrect`. |
| configurationParameter | List of DSC resource type, name, and value in the content package MOF file to be overridden after it's downloaded in the machine. |

### Deletion of manually created guest configuration assignments

Guest configuration assignments created through any manual approach (such as
an Azure Resource Manager template deployment) must be deleted manually.
Deleting the parent resource (virtual machine or Arc-enabled machine) will also
delete the guest configuration assignment.

To manually delete a guest configuration assignment, use the following
example. Make sure to replace all example strings, indicated by "\<\>" brackets.

```PowerShell
# First get details about the guest configuration assignment
$resourceDetails = @{
  ResourceGroupName = '<myResourceGroupName>'
  ResourceType      = 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/providers/guestConfigurationAssignments/'
  ResourceName      = '<myVMName>/Microsoft.GuestConfiguration'
  ApiVersion        = '2020-06-25'
}
$guestAssignment = Get-AzResource @resourceDetails

# Review details of the guest configuration assignment
$guestAssignment

# After reviewing properties of $guestAssignment to confirm
$guestAssignment | Remove-AzResource
```
