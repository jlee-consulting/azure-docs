# What is applicability in Azure Policy?

When a policy definition is assigned to a scope, Azure Policy determines which resources in that scope should be considered for compliance evaluation. A resource will only be assessed for compliance if it is considered **applicable** to the given policy assignment. 

Applicability is determined by several factors:
- **Conditions** in the `if` block of the [policy rule](../concepts/definition-structure.md#policy-rule).
- **Mode** of the policy definition.
- **Excluded scopes** specified in the assignment. 
- **Exemptions** of resources or resource hierarchies.

Condition(s) in the `if` block of the policy rule are evaluated for applicability in slightly different ways based on the effect.

> [!NOTE]
> Applicability is different from compliance, and the logic used to determine each is different. If a resource is **applicable** that means it is relevant to the policy. If a resource is **compliant** that means it adheres to the policy. Sometimes only certain conditions from the policy rule impact applicability, while all conditions of the policy rule impact compliance state.

## Applicability logic for Append/Modify/Audit/Deny/RP Mode specific effects

Azure Policy evaluates only `type`, `name`, and `kind` conditions in the policy rule `if` expression and treats other conditions as true (or false when negated). If the final evaluation result is true, the policy is applicable. Otherwise, it's not applicable.

Following are special cases to the previously described applicability logic:

|Scenario  |Result  |
|---------|---------|
|Any invalid aliases in the `if` conditions     |The policy is not applicable |
|When the `if` conditions consist of only `kind` conditions     |The policy is applicable to all resources |
|When the `if` conditions consist of only `name` conditions     |The policy is applicable to all resources |
|When the `if` conditions consist of only `type` and `kind` or `type` and `name` conditions     |Only type conditions are considered when deciding applicability |
|When any conditions (including deployment parameters) include a `location` condition     |Will not be applicable to subscriptions |

## Applicability logic for AuditIfNotExists and DeployIfNotExists policy effects

The applicability of AuditIfNotExists and DeployIfNotExists policies is based off the entire `if` condition of the policy rule. When the `if` evaluates to false, the policy is not applicable.
