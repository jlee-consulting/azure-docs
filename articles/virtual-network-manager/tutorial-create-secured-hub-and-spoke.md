# Tutorial: Create a secured hub and spoke network

In this tutorial, you'll create a hub and spoke network topology using Azure Virtual Network Manager. You'll then deploy a virtual network gateway in the hub virtual network to allow resources in the spoke virtual networks to communicate with remote networks using VPN. You'll also configure a security configuration to block outbound network traffic to the internet on ports 80 and 443. Lastly, you'll verify that configurations were applied correctly by looking at the virtual network and virtual machine settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Network Manager is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create multiple virtual networks.
> * Deploy a virtual network gateway.
> * Create a hub and spoke network topology.
> * Create a security configuration blocking traffic on port 80 and 443.
> * Verify configurations were applied.

## Prerequisite

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* Before you can complete steps in this tutorial, you must first [create an Azure Virtual Network Manager](create-virtual-network-manager-portal.md) instance.

## Create virtual networks

This procedure walks you through creating three virtual networks. One will be in the *West US* region and the other two will be in the *East US* region.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **+ Create a resource** and search for **Virtual network**. Then select **Create** to begin configuring the virtual network.

1. On the *Basics* tab, enter or select the following information:

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure Virtual Network Manager, you'll need to make sure all of following is true before you can delete the resource:

* There are no deployments of configurations to any region.
* All configurations have been deleted.
* All network groups have been deleted.

Use the [remove components checklist](concept-remove-components-checklist.md) to make sure no child resources are still available before deleting the resource group.
