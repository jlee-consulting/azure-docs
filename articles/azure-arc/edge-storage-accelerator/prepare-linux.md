# Prepare Linux (preview)

The article describes how to prepare Linux using AKS enabled by Azure Arc, Edge Essentials, or Ubuntu.

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum supported Linux kernel version is 5.1. At this time, there are known issues with 6.4 and 6.2.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Edge Storage Accelerator is only available in the following regions: East US, East US 2, West US 3, West Europe.

### Arc-connected Kubernetes cluster

These instructions assume that you already have an Arc-connected Kubernetes cluster. To connect an existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc, [see these instructions](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster?tabs=azure-cli).  

If you want to use Edge Storage Accelerator with Azure IoT Operations, follow the [instructions to create a cluster for Azure IoT Operations](/azure/iot-operations/get-started/quickstart-deploy?tabs=linux).

Use Ubuntu 22.04 on Standard D8s v3 machines with three SSDs attached for additional storage.

## Single-node and multi-node clusters

A single-node cluster is commonly used for development or testing purposes due to its simplicity in setup and minimal resource requirements. These clusters offer a lightweight and straightforward environment for developers to experiment with Kubernetes without the complexity of a multi-node setup. Additionally, in situations where resources such as CPU, memory, and storage are limited, a single-node cluster is more practical. Its ease of setup and minimal resource requirements make it a suitable choice in resource-constrained environments.

However, single-node clusters come with limitations, mostly in the form of missing features, including their lack of high availability, fault tolerance, scalability, and performance.

A multi-node Kubernetes configuration is typically used for production, staging, or large-scale scenarios because of its advantages, including high availability, fault tolerance, scalability, and performance. A multi-node cluster also introduces challenges and trade-offs, including complexity, overhead, cost, and efficiency considerations. For example, setting up and maintaining a multi-node cluster requires additional knowledge, skills, tools, and resources (network, storage, compute). The cluster must handle coordination and communication among nodes, leading to potential latency and errors. Additionally, running a multi-node cluster is more resource-intensive and is costlier than a single-node cluster. Optimization of resource usage among nodes is crucial for maintaining cluster and application efficiency and performance.

In summary, a [single-node Kubernetes cluster](single-node-cluster.md) might be suitable for development, testing, and resource-constrained environments, while a [multi-node cluster](multi-node-cluster.md) is more appropriate for production deployments, high availability, scalability, and scenarios where distributed applications are a requirement. This choice ultimately depends on your specific needs and goals for your deployment.

## Minimum hardware requirements

### Single-node or 2-node cluster

- Standard_D8ds_v4 VM recommended
- Equivalent specifications per node:
  - 4 CPUs
  - 16GB RAM

### Multi-node cluster

- Standard_D8as_v4 VM recommended
- Equivalent specifications per node:
  - 8 CPUs
  - 32GB RAM

32GB RAM serves as a buffer; however, 16GB RAM should suffice. Edge Essentials configurations require 8 CPUs with 10GB RAM per node, making 16GB RAM the minimum requirement.

## Next steps

- [Multi-node clusters](multi-node-cluster.md)
