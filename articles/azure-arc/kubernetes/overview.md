# What is Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes (Preview)

You can attach and configure Kubernetes clusters inside or outside of Azure with Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes (Preview). When a Kubernetes cluster is attached to Azure Arc, it will appear in the Azure Portal, have an Azure Resource Manager ID, and a Managed Identity. Clusters are attached to standard Azure subscriptions, live in a resource group, and can receive tags just like any other Azure resource. 


Connecting a Kubernetes cluster to Azure requires a cluster administrator to deploy agents. These agents run in a Kubernetes namespace named `azure-arc` and are standard Kubernetes deployments. The agents are responsible for connectivity to Azure, collecting Azure Arc logs and metrics, and watching for configuration requests.  
 
 > [!NOTE]
> Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is in preview and is not recommended for production workloads. 


## Supported Scenarios 

Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes supports the following scenarios: 

* Connecting Kubernetes running outside of Azure for inventory, grouping, and tagging 

* Deploy applications and apply configuration using GitOps-based configuration management 

* Use Azure Monitor for containers to view and monitor your clusters 

* Apply policies using Azure Policy for Kubernetes 

 
## Supported Regions 

Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is currently supported in the following regions: 

* East US 
* West Europe
