# Recover from accidental deletion of resource bridge virtual machine

In this article, you learn how to recover the Azure Arc resource bridge connection into a working state in disaster scenarios such as accidental deletion. In such cases, the connection between on-premises infrastructure and Azure is lost and any operations performed through Arc will fail.

## Recover the Arc resource bridge in case of virtual machine deletion

To recover from Arc resource bridge VM deletion, you need to deploy a new resource bridge with the same resource ID as the current resource bridge using the following steps.

>[!Note]
> This note is applicable only if you're performing this recovery operation to upgrade your Arc resource bridge.<br><br>
> If you have VMs that are still in the older version, i.e., have *Enabled (Deprecated)* set under the *Virtual hardware operations* column in the Virtual Machines inventory of your SCVMM server in Azure, switch them to the new version by following the steps in [this article](./switch-to-the-new-version-scvmm.md#switch-to-the-new-version-existing-customer) before proceeding with the steps for resource bridge recovery.

>[!Note]
> DHCP-based Arc Resource Bridge deployment is no longer supported.<br><br>
If you had deployed Arc Resource Bridge earlier using DHCP, you must clean up your deployment by removing your resources from Azure and do a [fresh onboarding](./quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc.md).

## Prerequisites

1. The disaster recovery script must be run from the same folder where the config (.yaml) files are present. The config files are present on the machine used to run the script to deploy Arc resource bridge. 

1. The machine being used to run the script must have bidirectional connectivity to the Arc resource bridge VM on port 6443 (Kubernetes API server) and 22 (SSH), and outbound connectivity to the Arc resource bridge VM on port 443 (HTTPS).


### Recover Arc resource bridge from a Windows machine

1.	Copy the Azure region and resource IDs of the Arc resource bridge, custom location, and SCVMM management server Azure resources.

2.	Download [this script](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/a/8/aa8687e4-1a30-485f-9de4-4f15fc576724/arcvmm-windows-dr.ps1) and update the following section in the script using the same information as the original resources in Azure. 

    ```powershell
    $location = <Azure region of the original Arc resource bridge>
    $applianceSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $applianceResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $applianceName = <resource-bridge-name>

    $customLocationSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $customLocationResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $customLocationName = <custom-location-name>

    $vmmserverSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $vmmserverResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $vmmserverName= <SCVMM-name-in-azure>
    ```
 
3.	Run the updated script from the same location where the config YAML files are stored after the initial onboarding. This is most likely the same folder from where you ran the initial onboarding script unless the config files were moved later to a different location. [Provide the inputs](quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc.md#script-runtime) as prompted. 

4.	Once the script is run successfully, the old Resource Bridge is recovered, and the connection is re-established to the existing Azure-enabled SCVMM resources.
