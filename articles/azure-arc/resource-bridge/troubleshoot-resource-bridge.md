# Troubleshoot Azure Arc resource bridge issues

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that could occur while attempting to deploy, use, or remove the Azure Arc resource bridge. The resource bridge is a packaged virtual machine, which hosts a *management* Kubernetes cluster. For general information, see [Azure Arc resource bridge overview](./overview.md).

## General issues

### Logs collection

For issues encountered with Arc resource bridge, collect logs for further investigation using the Azure CLI [`az arcappliance logs`](/cli/azure/arcappliance/logs) command. This command needs to be run from the management machine used to deploy the Arc resource bridge. If you're using a different machine, the machine must meet the [management machine requirements](system-requirements.md#management-machine-requirements).

If there's a problem collecting logs, most likely the management machine is unable to reach the Appliance VM. Contact your network administrator to allow SSH communication from the management machine to the Appliance VM on TCP port 22. 

You can collect the Arc resource bridge logs by passing either the appliance VM IP or the kubeconfig in the logs command. 

To collect Arc resource bridge logs on VMware using the appliance VM IP address: 

   ```azurecli
   az arcappliance logs vmware --ip <appliance VM IP> --username <vSphere username> --password <vSphere password> --address <vCenter address> --out-dir <path to output directory>
   ```

To collect Arc resource bridge logs for Azure Stack HCI using the appliance VM IP address: 

   ```azurecli
   az arcappliance logs hci --ip <appliance VM IP> --cloudagent <cloud agent service IP/FQDN> --loginconfigfile <file path of kvatoken.tok> 
   ```

If you're unsure of your appliance VM IP, there's also the option to use the kubeconfig. You can retrieve the kubeconfig by running the [get-credentials command](/cli/azure/arcappliance) then run the logs command.

To retrieve the kubeconfig and log key then collect logs for Arc-enabled VMware from a different machine than the one used to deploy Arc resource bridge for Arc-enabled VMware:

   ```azurecli
az account set -s <subscription id>
az arcappliance get-credentials -n <Arc resource bridge name> -g <resource group name> 
az arcappliance logs vmware --kubeconfig kubeconfig --out-dir <path to specified output directory>
   ```

### Download/upload connectivity was not successful
If your network speed is slow you may be unable to successfully download the Arc resource bridge VM image and this error may occur: `ErrorCode: ValidateKvaError, Error: Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity was not successful. Timeout error occurred during download and preparation of appliance image to the on-premises fabric storage. Common causes of this timeout error are slow network download/upload speeds, a proxy limiting the network speed or slow storage performance.`

If the error is due to slow network speed impacting upload, a workaround is to create a VM directly on the on-premises private cloud and then run the Arc resource bridge deployment script from that VM. This workaround ensures a faster upload of the image to the datastore.


### Context timed out during phase `ApplyingKvaImageOperator`
You may receive the following error while deploying Arc resource bridge: `Deployment of the Arc resource bridge appliance VM timed out. Please collect logs with _az arcappliance logs_ and create a support ticket for help. To troubleshoot the error, refer to aka.ms/arc-rb-error   { _errorCode_: _ContextError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_Context timed out during phase _ApplyingKvaImageOperator_\_\n}_ }`

This error typically occurs when trying to download the `KVAIO` image (400 MB compressed) over a network that is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity. The `KVAIO` controller manager is waiting for the image download to complete and times out. You may want to check that your network speed between the Arc resource bridge VM and Microsoft Container Registry (`mcr.microsoft.com`) is stable and at least 2 Mbps. If your network connectivity and speed are stable and you are still getting this error, wait at least 30 minutes before you re-try as Microsoft Container Registry may be receiving a high volume of traffic.

### Context timed out during phase `WaitingForAPIServer`
When deploying Arc resource bridge, you may receive the error: `Deployment of the Arc resource bridge appliance VM timed out. Please collect logs with _az arcappliance logs_ and create a support ticket for help. To troubleshoot the error, refer to aka.ms/arc-rb-error   { _errorCode_: _ContextError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_Context timed out during phase _WaitingForAPIServer`

This error indicates that the deployment machine is unable to contact the control plane IP for Arc resource bridge within the time limit. Common causes of the error are often networking related, such as communication between the deployment machine and control plane IP being routed through a proxy. Traffic from the deployment machine to the control plane and the appliance VM IPs must not pass through proxy. If traffic is being proxied, then configure the proxy settings on your network or deployment machine to not proxy traffic between the deployment machine to the control plane IP and appliance VM IPs. Another cause for this error is if a firewall is closing access to port 6443 and port 22 between the deployment machine and control plane IP or the deployment machine and appliance VM IPs.

### `UploadError` 403 Forbidden or 404 Site Not Found
When deploying Arc resource bridge, you may receive the error: `{ _errorCode_: _UploadError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity was not successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_403 Forbidden` or `{ _errorCode_: _UploadError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity was not successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_404 Site Not Found`

This error occurs in the deployment process when images need to be downloaded from Microsoft registries to the deployment machine and the download is being blocked by a proxy or firewall. Review the [network requirements](network-requirements.md#general-network-requirements) and verify that all required URLs are reachable. You may need to update your no proxy settings to ensure that traffic from your deployment machine to Microsoft required URLs are not going through a proxy.

### SSH folder access denied

The CLI requires permission to access the SSH folder during deployment or operations that involve accessing files within the folder. This folder contains essential files such as the kubeconfig and logs key for the appliance VM. For instance, the CLI needs to access the logs key stored in the SSH folder to collect logs from the appliance VM.

If you encounter an error stating: `Access to the file in the SSH folder was denied. This may occur if the CLI doesn't have permission to the SSH folder or if another CLI instance is using the file`, there are two common causes for this issue:

1. Insufficient permissions: The CLI lacks the necessary permissions to access the SSH folder. Ensure that the user account running the CLI has appropriate permissions to access the SSH folder.

1. Concurrent file access: Another instance of the CLI might be using the file in the SSH folder. This often happens on workstations with shared profiles. Ensure that any other CLI instance completes or terminates its operation before you proceed. 

### Arc resource bridge is offline

If the resource bridge is offline, this is typically due to a networking change in the infrastructure, environment or cluster that stops the appliance VM from being able to  communicate with its counterpart Azure resource. If you're unable to determine what changed, you can reboot the appliance VM, collect logs and submit a support ticket for further investigation. 

### Remote PowerShell isn't supported

If you run `az arcappliance` CLI commands for Arc Resource Bridge via remote PowerShell, you might experience various problems. For instance, you might see an [authentication handshake failure error when trying to install the resource bridge on an Azure Stack HCI cluster](#authentication-handshake-failure) or another type of error. Using `az arcappliance` commands from remote PowerShell isn't currently supported. Instead, sign in to the node through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or use a console session.

### Resource bridge configurations can't be updated

In this release, all the parameters are specified at time of creation. To update the Azure Arc resource bridge, you must delete it and redeploy it again. For example, if you specified the wrong location, or subscription during deployment, later the resource creation fails. If you only try to recreate the resource without redeploying the resource bridge VM, you'll see the status stuck at `WaitForHeartBeat`. To resolve this issue, delete the appliance and update the appliance YAML file. Then redeploy and create the resource bridge.

### Appliance Network Unavailable 

If Arc resource bridge is experiencing a network problem, you may see an "Appliance Network Unavailable" error. In general, any network or infrastructure connectivity issue to the appliance VM may cause this error. This error can also surface as "Error while dialing dial tcp xx.xx.xxx.xx:55000: connect: no route to host". The problem could be that communication from the host to the Arc resource bridge VM needs to be opened over TCP port 22 with the help of your network administrator. A temporary network issue may not allow the host to reach the Arc resource bridge VM. Once the network issue is resolved, you can retry the operation. You can also check that the appliance VM for Arc resource bridge isn't stopped or offline. In the case of Azure Stack HCI, the host storage may be full and the storage needs to be addressed. 

### Token refresh error

When you run the Azure CLI commands, the following error might be returned: *The refresh token has expired or is invalid due to sign-in frequency checks by conditional access.* The error occurs because when you sign in to Azure, the token has a maximum lifetime. When that lifetime is exceeded, you need to sign in to Azure again by using the `az login` command.

### Default host resource pools are unavailable for deployment

When using the `az arcappliance createconfig` or `az arcappliance run` command, there is an interactive experience that shows the list of the VMware entities where you can select to deploy the virtual appliance. This list shows all user-created resource pools. along with default cluster resource pools, but the default host resource pools aren't listed. When the appliance is deployed to a host resource pool, there's no high availability if the host hardware fails. We recommend that you don't deploy the appliance in a host resource pool.

### Resource bridge status "Offline" and `provisioningState` "Failed"

When deploying Arc resource bridge, the bridge might appear to be successfully deployed, because no errors were encountered when running `az arcappliance deploy` or `az arcappliance create`. However, when viewing the bridge in Azure portal, you might see status shows as **Offline**, and `az arcappliance show` might show the `provisioningState` as **Failed**. This happens when required providers aren't registered before the bridge is deployed.

To resolve this problem, delete the resource bridge, register the providers, then redeploy the resource bridge.

1. Delete the resource bridge:

   ```azurecli
   az arcappliance delete <fabric> --config-file <path to appliance.yaml>
   ```

1. Register the providers:

   ```azurecli
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation –-wait
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ResourceConnector –-wait
   ```

1. Redeploy the resource bridge.

> [!NOTE]
> Partner products (such as Arc-enabled VMware vSphere) might have their own required providers to register. To see additional providers that must be registered, see the product's documentation.

### Expired credentials in the appliance VM

Arc resource bridge consists of an appliance VM that is deployed to the on-premises infrastructure. The appliance VM maintains a connection to the management endpoint of the on-premises infrastructure using locally stored credentials. If these credentials aren't updated, the resource bridge is no longer able to communicate with the management endpoint. This can cause problems when trying to upgrade the resource bridge or manage VMs through Azure. To fix this, the credentials in the appliance VM need to be updated. For more information, see [Update credentials in the appliance VM](maintenance.md#update-credentials-in-the-appliance-vm).

### Private link is unsupported

Arc resource bridge doesn't support private link. All calls coming from the appliance VM shouldn't be going through your private link setup. The Private Link IPs may conflict with the appliance IP pool range, which isn't configurable on the resource bridge. Arc resource bridge reaches out to [required URLs](network-requirements.md#firewallproxy-url-allowlist) that shouldn't go through a private link connection. You must deploy Arc resource bridge on a separate network segment unrelated to the private link setup.


## Networking issues

### Back-off pulling image error

When trying to deploy Arc resource bridge, you might see an error that contains `back-off pulling image \\\"url"\\\: FailFastPodCondition`. This error is caused when the appliance VM can't reach the URL specified in the error. To resolve this issue, make sure the appliance VM meets system requirements, including internet access connectivity to [required allowlist URLs](network-requirements.md).

### Not able to connect to URL

If you receive an error that contains `Not able to connect to https://example.url.com`, check with your network administrator to ensure your network allows all of the required firewall and proxy URLs to deploy Arc resource bridge. For more information, see [Azure Arc resource bridge network requirements](network-requirements.md).

### Http2 server sent GOAWAY

When trying to deploy Arc resource bridge, you might receive an error message similar to:

`"errorResponse": "{\n\"message\": \"Post \\\"https://region.dp.kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com/azure-arc-appliance-k8sagents/GetLatestHelmPackagePath?api-version=2019-11-01-preview\\u0026releaseTrain=stable\\\": http2: server sent GOAWAY and closed the connection; LastStreamID=1, ErrCode=NO_ERROR, debug=\\\"\\\"\"\n}"`

This occurs when a firewall or proxy has SSL/TLS inspection enabled and blocks http2 calls from the machine used to deploy the resource bridge. To confirm this is the problem, run the following PowerShell cmdlet to invoke the web request with http2 (requires PowerShell version 7 or above), replacing the region in the URL and api-version (ex:2019-11-01) with values from the error:

`Invoke-WebRequest -HttpVersion 2.0 -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://region.dp.kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com/azure-arc-appliance-k8sagents/GetLatestHelmPackagePath?api-version=2019-11-01-preview"&"releaseTrain=stable -Method Post -Verbose`

If the result is `The response ended prematurely while waiting for the next frame from the server`, then the http2 call is being blocked and needs to be allowed. Work with your network administrator to disable the SSL/TLS inspection to allow http2 calls from the machine used to deploy the bridge.

### No such host - .local not supported
When trying to set the configuration for Arc resource bridge, you might receive an error message similar to:

`"message": "Post \"https://esx.lab.local/52c-acac707ce02c/disk-0.vmdk\": dial tcp: lookup esx.lab.local: no such host"`

This occurs when a `.local` path is provided for a configuration setting, such as proxy, dns, datastore or management endpoint (such as vCenter). Arc resource bridge appliance VM uses Azure Linux OS, which doesn't support `.local` by default. A workaround could be to provide the IP address where applicable.

### Azure Arc resource bridge is unreachable

Azure Arc resource bridge runs a Kubernetes cluster, and its control plane requires a static IP address. The IP address is specified in the `infra.yaml` file. If the IP address is assigned from a DHCP server, the address can change if it's not reserved. Rebooting the Azure Arc resource bridge or VM can trigger an IP address change and result in failing services.

Arc resource bridge may intermittently lose the reserved IP configuration. This loss is due to the behavior described in [loss of VIPs when `systemd-networkd` is restarted](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1385). When the IP address isn't assigned to the Azure Arc resource bridge VM, any call to the resource bridge API server fails. Core operations, such as creating a new resource, connecting to your private cloud from Azure, or creating a custom location, won't function as expected. To resolve this issue, reboot the resource bridge VM, and it should recover its IP address. If the address is assigned from a DHCP server, reserve the IP address associated with the resource bridge.

The Arc resource bridge may also be unreachable due to slow disk access. Azure Arc resource bridge uses Kubernetes extended configuration tree (ETCD), which requires [latency of 10ms or less](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/scalability_and_performance/recommended-host-practices.html#recommended-etcd-practices_). If the underlying disk has low performance, operations are impacted and failures may occur.

### SSL proxy configuration issues

Be sure that the proxy server on your management machine trusts both the SSL certificate for your SSL proxy and the SSL certificate of the Microsoft download servers. For more information, see [SSL proxy configuration](network-requirements.md#ssl-proxy-configuration).

### No such host - dp.kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com

An error that contains `dial tcp: lookup westeurope.dp.kubernetesconfiguration.azure.com: no such host` while deploying Arc resource bridge means that the configuration dataplane is currently unavailable in the specified region. The service may be temporarily unavailable. Please wait for the service to be available and then retry the deployment.

### Proxy connect tcp - No such host for Arc resource bridge required URL

An error that contains an Arc resource bridge required URL with the message `proxyconnect tcp: dial tcp: lookup http: no such host` indicates that DNS is not able to resolve the URL. The error may look similar to the example below, where the required URL is `https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com`:

`Error:  { _errorCode_: _InvalidEntityError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_Post \\\_https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com/api/v1.1/contents/default/namespaces/default/names/arc-appliance-stable-catalogs-ext/versions/latest?action=select\\\_: POST https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com/api/v1.1/contents/default/namespaces/default/names/arc-appliance-stable-catalogs-ext/versions/latest?action=select giving up after 6 attempt(s): Post \\\_https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com/api/v1.1/contents/default/namespaces/default/names/arc-appliance-stable-catalogs-ext/versions/latest?action=select\\\_: proxyconnect tcp: dial tcp: lookup http: no such host\_\n}_ }`

This error can occur if the DNS settings provided during deployment are not correct or there is a problem with the DNS server(s). You can check if your DNS server is able to resolve the url by running the following command from the management machine or a machine that has access to the DNS server(s): 

```
nslookup
> set debug
> <hostname> <DNS server IP>
```

In order to resolve the error, your DNS server(s) must be configured to resolve all Arc resource bridge required URLs and the DNS server(s) should be correctly provided during deployment of Arc resource bridge.

### KVA timeout error

The KVA timeout error is a generic error that can be the result of a variety of network misconfigurations that involve the management machine, Appliance VM, or Control Plane IP not having communication with each other, to the internet, or required URLs. This communication failure is often due to issues with DNS resolution, proxy settings, network configuration, or internet access. 

For clarity, management machine refers to the machine where deployment CLI commands are being run. Appliance VM is the VM that hosts Arc resource bridge. Control Plane IP is the IP of the control plane for the Kubernetes management cluster in the Appliance VM.

#### Top causes of the KVA timeout error  

- Management machine is unable to communicate with Control Plane IP and Appliance VM IP.
- Appliance VM is unable to communicate with the management machine, vCenter endpoint (for VMware), or MOC cloud agent endpoint (for Azure Stack HCI).  
- Appliance VM doesn't have internet access.
- Appliance VM has internet access, but connectivity to one or more required URLs is being blocked, possibly due to a proxy or firewall.
- Appliance VM is unable to reach a DNS server that can resolve internal names, such as vCenter endpoint for vSphere or cloud agent endpoint for Azure Stack HCI. The DNS server must also be able to resolve external addresses, such as Azure service addresses and container registry names.  
- Proxy server configuration on the management machine or Arc resource bridge configuration files is incorrect. This can impact both the management machine and the Appliance VM. When the `az arcappliance prepare` command is run, the management machine won't be able to connect and download OS images if the host proxy isn't correctly configured. Internet access on the Appliance VM might be broken by incorrect or missing proxy configuration, which impacts the VM’s ability to pull container images.  

#### Troubleshoot KVA timeout error

To resolve the error, one or more network misconfigurations might need to be addressed. Follow the steps below to address the most common reasons for this error.

1. When there's a problem with deployment, the first step is to collect logs by Appliance VM IP (not by kubeconfig, as the kubeconfig could be empty if the deploy command didn't complete). Problems collecting logs are most likely due to the management machine being unable to reach the Appliance VM.

   Once logs are collected, extract the folder and open kva.log. Review the kva.log for more information on the failure to help pinpoint the cause of the KVA timeout error.

1. The management machine must be able to communicate with the Appliance VM IP and Control Plane IP. Ping the Control Plane IP and Appliance VM IP from the management machine and verify there's a response from both IPs.

   If a request times out, the management machine can't communicate with the IP(s). This could be caused by a closed port, network misconfiguration or a firewall block. Work with your network administrator to allow communication between the management machine to the Control Plane IP and Appliance VM IP.

1. Appliance VM IP and Control Plane IP must be able to communicate with the management machine and vCenter endpoint (for VMware) or MOC cloud agent endpoint (for HCI). Work with your network administrator to ensure the network is configured to permit this. This might require adding a firewall rule to open port 443 from the Appliance VM IP and Control Plane IP to vCenter or port 65000 and 55000 for Azure Stack HCI MOC cloud agent. Review [network requirements for Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-prerequisites#network-port-requirements) and [VMware](../vmware-vsphere/quick-start-connect-vcenter-to-arc-using-script.md) for Arc resource bridge.

1. Appliance VM IP and Control Plane IP need internet access to [these required URLs](#not-able-to-connect-to-url). Azure Stack HCI requires [additional URLs](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-arc-vm-management-prerequisites). Work with your network administrator to ensure that the IPs can access the required URLs.

1. In a non-proxy environment, the management machine must have external and internal DNS resolution. The management machine must be able to reach a DNS server that can resolve internal names such as vCenter endpoint for vSphere or cloud agent endpoint for Azure Stack HCI. The DNS server also needs to be able to [resolve external addresses](#not-able-to-connect-to-url), such as Azure URLs and OS image download URLs. Work with your system administrator to ensure that the management machine has internal and external DNS resolution. In a proxy environment, the DNS resolution on the proxy server should resolve internal endpoints and [required external addresses](#not-able-to-connect-to-url).

   To test DNS resolution to an internal address from the management machine in a non-proxy scenario, open command prompt and run `nslookup <vCenter endpoint or HCI MOC cloud agent IP>`. You should receive an answer if the management machine has internal DNS resolution in a non-proxy scenario.  

1. Appliance VM needs to be able to reach a DNS server that can resolve internal names such as vCenter endpoint for vSphere or cloud agent endpoint for Azure Stack HCI. The DNS server also needs to be able to resolve external/internal addresses, such as Azure service addresses and container registry names for download of the Arc resource bridge container images from the cloud.

   Verify that the DNS server IP used to create the configuration files has internal and external address resolution. If not, [delete the appliance](/cli/azure/arcappliance/delete), recreate the Arc resource bridge configuration files with the correct DNS server settings, and then deploy Arc resource bridge using the new configuration files.
   
## Move Arc resource bridge location

Resource move of Arc resource bridge isn't currently supported. You'll need to delete the Arc resource bridge, then re-deploy it to the desired location. 

## Azure Arc-enabled VMs on Azure Stack HCI issues

For general help resolving issues related to Azure Arc-enabled VMs on Azure Stack HCI, see [Troubleshoot Azure Arc-enabled virtual machines](/azure-stack/hci/manage/troubleshoot-arc-enabled-vms).

### Authentication handshake failure

When running an `az arcappliance` command, you might see a connection error: `authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

This is usually caused when trying to run commands from remote PowerShell, which isn't supported by Azure Arc resource bridge.

To install Azure Arc resource bridge on an Azure Stack HCI cluster, `az arcappliance` commands must be run locally on a node in the cluster. Sign in to the node through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or use a console session to run these commands.

## Azure Arc-enabled VMware VCenter issues

### errorCode: CreateConfigKvaCustomerError, errorResponse: error getting the vsphere sdk client

For errors with errorCode `CreateConfigKvaCustomerError` and errorResponse `error getting the vsphere sdk client`, these errors occur when your deployment machine is trying to establish a TCP connection to your vCenter address but encounters a problem. You receive this errorCode and errorResponse if your vCenter address is incorrect (403 or 404 error) or if there's a network/proxy/firewall configuration blocking it (connection attempt failed). If you enter your vCenter address as a hostname and receive the error `no such host`, then your deployment machine isn't able to resolve the vCenter hostname via the client DNS. You may receive an error if the deployment machine is able to resolve the vCenter hostname but the deployment machine can't reach the IP address it received from DNS. You may receive an error if the endpoint returned by DNS isn't your vCenter address, or if the traffic was intercepted by proxy. Finally, you may get an error if your deployment machine is able to communicate with your vCenter address, but the username or password is incorrect.

### vSphere SDK client - Connection attempt failed

If you receive an error during deployment that states: `errorCode_: _CreateConfigKvaCustomerError_, _errorResponse_: _error getting the vsphere sdk client: Post \_https://ip.address/sdk\_: dial tcp ip.address:443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond._ }` then your deployment machine is not able to communicate with your vCenter server. Ensure that your deployment machine meets the [management machine requirements](system-requirements.md#management-machine-requirements) and that there is not a firewall or proxy blocking communication. 

### vSphere SDK client - 403 Forbidden or 404 not found

If you receive an error that contains `errorCode_: _CreateConfigKvaCustomerError_, _errorResponse_: _error getting the vsphere sdk client: POST \_/sdk\_: 403 Forbidden` or `404 not found` while deploying Arc resource bridge, this is most likely due to an incorrect vCenter address being provided during configuration file creation when you're prompted to enter the vCenter address as either a hostname or IP address. There are different ways to find your vCenter address. One option is to access the vSphere client via its web interface. The vCenter hostname or IP address is typically what you use in the browser to access the vSphere client. If you're already logged in, you can look at the browser's address bar; the URL you use to access vSphere is your vCenter server's hostname or IP address. Verify your vCenter address and then re-try the deployment.

### vSphere SDK client - no such host

If you encounter the error `{ _errorCode_: _CreateConfigKvaCustomerError_, _errorResponse_: _error getting the vsphere sdk client: Post \_https://your.vcenter.hostname/sdk\_: dial tcp: lookup your.vcenter.hostname: no such host_ }` during deployment, then the deployment machine can't resolve the vCenter hostname to an IP address. This issue arises because the deployment process is attempting to establish a TCP connection from your deployment machine to the vCenter hostname but fails due to DNS resolution problems. To address this, ensure the DNS configuration on your deployment machine is correct, verify that the DNS server is online, and check for a missing DNS entry for the vCenter hostname. You can test the DNS resolution by running `nslookup your.vcenter.hostname` or `ping your.vcenter.hostname` from the deployment machine. If you've specified your vCenter address as a hostname, consider using the IP address directly instead.

### Pre-deployment validation errors

If you're receiving a variety of `pre-deployment validation of your download\upload connectivity wasn't successful` errors, such as: 

`Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity wasn't successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_Post \\\\\\\_https://vcenter-server.com/nfc/unique-identifier/disk-0.vmdk\\\\\\\_: Service Unavailable`

`Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity wasn't successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_Post \\\\\\\_https://vcenter-server.com/nfc/unique-identifier/disk-0.vmdk\\\\\\\_: dial tcp 172.16.60.10:443: connectex: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.`

`Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity wasn't successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_Post \\\\\\\_https://vcenter-server.com/nfc/unique-identifier/disk-0.vmdk\\\\\\\_: use of closed network connection.`

`Pre-deployment validation of your download/upload connectivity wasn't successful. {\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_ImageProvisionError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_Post \\\\\\\_https://vcenter-server.com/nfc/unique-identifier/disk-0.vmdk\\\\\\\_: dial tcp: lookup hostname.domain: no such host`

A combination of these errors usually indicates that the management machine has lost connection to the datastore or there's a networking issue causing the datastore to be unreachable. This connection is needed in order to upload the OVA from the management machine used to build the appliance VM in vCenter. The connection between the management machine and datastore needs to be reestablished, then retry deployment of Arc resource bridge.

### x509 certificate has expired or isn't yet valid

When you deploy Arc resource bridge, you may encounter the error: 

`Error: { _errorCode_: _PostOperationsError_, _errorResponse_: _{\n\_message\_: \_{\\n  \\\_code\\\_: \\\_GuestInternetConnectivityError\\\_,\\n  \\\_message\\\_: \\\_Not able to connect to https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com. Error returned: action failed after 3 attempts: Get \\\\\\\_https://msk8s.api.cdp.microsoft.com\\\\\\\_: x509: certificate has expired or isn't yet valid: current time 2022-01-18T11:35:56Z is before 2023-09-07T19:13:21Z. Arc Resource Bridge network and internet connectivity validation failed: http-connectivity-test-arc. 1. Please check your networking setup and ensure the URLs mentioned in : https://aka.ms/AAla73m are reachable from the Appliance VM.   2. Check firewall/proxy settings` 

This error is caused when there's a clock/time difference between ESXi host(s) and the management machine where the deployment commands for Arc resource bridge are being executed. To resolve this issue, turn on NTP time sync on the ESXi host(s) and confirm that the management machine is also synced to NTP, then try the deployment again.

### Arc resource bridge status is disconnected

When running the initial Arc-enabled VMware onboarding script, you were prompted to provide a vSphere account. This account is stored locally within the Arc resource bridge as an encrypted Kubernetes secret. The account is used to allow the Arc resource bridge to interact with vCenter. If your Arc resource bridge status is disconnected, this may be due to the vSphere account stored locally within the resource bridge being expired. You must update the credentials within Arc resource bridge and for Arc-enabled VMware by [following the updating vSphere account credentials instructions](/azure/azure-arc/vmware-vsphere/administer-arc-vmware#updating-the-vsphere-account-credentials-using-a-new-password-or-a-new-vsphere-account-after-onboarding).


### Error during host configuration

If you have been using the same template to deploy and delete the Arc resource bridge multiple times, you might encounter the following error:

`Appliance cluster deployment failed with error: Error: An error occurred during host configuration`

To resolve this issue, manually delete the existing template. Then run [`az arcappliance prepare`](/cli/azure/arcappliance/prepare) to download a new template for deployment.

### Unable to find folders

When deploying Arc resource bridge on VMware, you specify the folder in which the template and VM are created. The selected folder must be a VM and template folder type. Other types of folder, such as storage folders, network folders, or host and cluster folders, can't be used for the resource bridge deployment.

### Insufficient permissions

When deploying the resource bridge on VMware vCenter, you might get an error saying that you have insufficient permission. To resolve this issue, make sure that the user account being used to deploy the resource bridge has all of the following privileges in VMware vCenter and then try again.
