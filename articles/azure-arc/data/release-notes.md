  - BACKUP DATABASE TO URL to S3-compatible storage is introduced for preview. Limited to COPY_ONLY. [Documentation](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-and-restore-with-s3-compatible-object-storage).
  - `az sql mi-arc create` and `update` commands have a new `--sync-secondary-commit` parameter which is the number of secondary replicas that must be synchronized to fail over. Default is `-1` which sets the number of required synchronized secondaries to (# of replicas - 1) / 2.  Allowed values: `-1`, `1`, or `2`.  Arc SQL MI custom resource property added called `syncSecondaryToCommit`.
  - Billing estimate in Azure portal is updated to reflect the number of readable secondaries that are selected.

## May 4, 2022

This release is published May 4, 2022.

**Image tag**: `v1.6.0_2022-05-02`

For complete release version information, see [Version log](version-log.md#may-4-2022).

### Data controller

Added:

- Create, update, and delete AD connector 
- Create SQL Managed Instance with AD connectivity to the Azure CLI extension in direct connectivity mode.

Data controller sends controller logs to the Log Analytics Workspace if logs upload is enabled. 

Removed the `--ad-connector-namespace` parameter from `az sql mi-arc create` command because for now the AD connector resource must always be in the same namespace as the SQL Managed Instance resource.

Updated Elasticsearch to latest version `7.9.1-36fefbab37-205465`.  Also Grafana, Kibana, Telegraf, Fluent Bit, Go.

All container image sizes were reduced by approximately 40% on average.

Introduced new `create-sql-keytab.ps1` PowerShell script to aid in creation of keytabs.

### SQL Managed Instance

Separated the availability group and failover group status into two different sections on Kubernetes.

Updated SQL engine binaries to the latest version.

Add support for `NodeSelector`, `TopologySpreadConstraints` and `Affinity`.  Only available through Kubernetes yaml/json file create/edit currently.  No Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Azure Data Studio user experience yet.

Add support for specifying labels and annotations on the secondary service endpoint. `REQUIRED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT` is now a function of the number of replicas.  

- If three replicas: `REQUIRED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT = 1`.  
- If one or two replicas: `REQUIRED_SECONDARIES_TO_COMMIT = 0`.

In this release, the default value of the readable secondary service is `Cluster IP`.  The secondary service type can be set in the Kubernetes yaml/json at `spec.services.readableSecondaries.type`. In the next release, the default value will be the same as the primary service type.

### User experience improvements

Notifications added in Azure portal if billing data hasn't been uploaded to Azure recently.

#### Azure Data Studio

Added upgrade experience for Data Controller in direct and indirect connectivity mode.

## April 6, 2022

This release is published April 6, 2022.

**Image tag**: `v1.5.0_2022-04-05`

For complete release version information, see [Version log](version-log.md#april-6-2022).

### Data controller

- Logs are retained in ElasticSearch for 2 weeks by default now.
- Upgrades are now limited to only upgrading to the next incremental minor or major version. For example:
   - Supported version upgrades: 
      - 1.1 -> 1.2 
      - 1.3 -> 2.0 
   - Not supported version upgrade.
      - 1.1. -> 1.4
         Not supported because one or more minor versions are skipped.
- Updates to open source projects included in Azure Arc-enabled data services to patch vulnerabilities.

### SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc

You can create a maintenance window on the data controller, and if you have SQL managed instances with a desired version set to `auto`, they will be upgraded in the next maintenance windows after a data controller upgrade. 

Metrics for each replica in a Business Critical instance are now sent to the Azure portal so you can view them in the monitoring charts.

AD authentication connectors can now be set up in an `automatic mode` or *system-managed keytab* which will use a service account to automatically create SQL service accounts, SPNs, and DNS entries as an alternative to the AD authentication connectors which use the *customer-managed keytab* mode.

> [!NOTE]
> In some early releases customer-managed keytab mode was called *bring your own keytab* mode.

Backup and point-in-time-restore when a database has Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled is now supported.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is now enabled in SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc.

Bug fixes for replica scaling in Arc SQL MI Business Critical and database restore when there is insufficient disk space.

Distributed availability groups have been renamed to failover groups. The `az sql mi-arc dag` command group has been moved to `az sql instance-failover-group-arc`. Before upgrade, delete all resources of the `dag` resource type.

### User experience improvements

You can now use the Azure CLI `az arcdata dc create` command to create:
- A custom location
- A data services extension
- A data controller in one command.

New enforcements of constraints:

- The data controller and managed instance resources it manages must be in the same resource group.
- There can only be one data controller in a given custom location.

#### Azure Data Studio

During direct connected mode data controller creation, you can now specify the log analytics workspace information for auto sync upload of the logs.

## March 2022

This release is published March 8, 2022.

**Image tag**: `v1.4.1_2022-03-08`

For complete release version information, see [Version log](version-log.md#march-8-2022).

### Data Controller
- Fixed the issue "ConfigMap sql-config-[SQL MI] does not exist" from the February 2022 release. This issue occurs when deploying a SQL Managed Instance with service type of `loadBalancer` with certain load balancers. 

## February 2022

This release is published February 25, 2022.

**Image tag**: `v1.4.0_2022-02-25`

For complete release version information, see [Version log](version-log.md#february-25-2022).

> [!CAUTION] 
> There's a known issue with this release where deployment of Arc SQL MI hangs, and sends the controldb pods of Arc Data Controller into a
> `CrashLoopBackOff` state, when the SQL MI is deployed with `loadBalancer` service type. This issue is fixed in a release on March 08, 2022. 

### SQL Managed Instance

- Support for readable secondary replicas:
    - To set readable secondary replicas use `--readable-secondaries` when you create or update an Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance deployment. 
    - Set `--readable-secondaries` to any value between 0 and the number of replicas minus 1.
    - `--readable-secondaries` only applies to Business Critical tier. 
- Automatic backups are taken on the primary instance in a Business Critical service tier when there are multiple replicas. When a failover happens, backups move to the new primary. 
- [ReadWriteMany (RWX) capable storage class](../../aks/concepts-storage.md#azure-disk) is required for backups, for both General Purpose and Business Critical service tiers. Specifying a non-ReadWriteMany storage class will cause the SQL Managed Instance to be stuck in "Pending" status during deployment.
- Billing support when using multiple read replicas.

For additional information about service tiers, see [High Availability with SQL Managed Instance enabled by Azure Arc (preview)](managed-instance-high-availability.md).

### User experience improvements

The following improvements are available in [Azure Data Studio](/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).

- Azure Arc and Azure CLI extensions now generally available. 
- Changed edit commands for SQL Managed Instance for Azure Arc dashboard to use `update`, reflecting Azure CLI changes. This works in indirect or direct mode. 
- Data controller deployment wizard step for connectivity mode is now earlier in the process.
- Removed an extra backups field in SQL MI deployment wizard.
