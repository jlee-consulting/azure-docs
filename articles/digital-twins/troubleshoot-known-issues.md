# Known issues in Azure Digital Twins

This article provides information about known issues associated with Azure Digital Twins.

## "400 Client Error: Bad Request" in Cloud Shell

Commands in Cloud Shell may intermittently fail with the error "400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: http://localhost:50342/oauth2/token" followed by full stack trace.

### Troubleshooting steps

This can be resolved by re-running the `az login` command and completing subsequent login steps.

After this, you should be able to re-run the command.

### Possible causes

This is the result of a known issue in Cloud Shell: [*Getting token from Cloud Shell intermittently fails with 400 Client Error: Bad Request*](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/11749).

## Missing role assignment after scripted setup

Some users may experience issues with the role assignment portion of [*How-to: Set up an instance and authentication (scripted)*](how-to-set-up-instance-scripted.md). The script does not indicate failure, but the *Azure Digital Twins Owner (Preview)* role is not successfully assigned to the user, and this will impact ability to create other resources down the road.

To determine whether your role assignment was successfully set up after running the script, follow the instructions in the [*Verify user role assignment*](how-to-set-up-instance-scripted.md#verify-user-role-assignment) section of the setup article. If your user is not shown with this role, this issue affects you.

### Troubleshooting steps

To resolve, you can set up your role assignment manually using either the CLI or Azure portal. 

Follow these instructions:
* [CLI](how-to-set-up-instance-cli.md#set-up-user-access-permissions)
* [portal](how-to-set-up-instance-portal.md#set-up-user-access-permissions)

### Possible causes

For users logged in with a personal [Microsoft account (MSA)](https://account.microsoft.com/account), your user's Principal ID that identifies you in commands like this may be different from your user's login email, making it difficult for the script to discover and use to assign the role properly.

## Issue with interactive browser authentication

When writing authentication code in your Azure Digital Twins applications using the latest version (version **1.2.0**) of the **[Azure.Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity?view=azure-dotnet) library**, you may experience issues with the [InteractiveBrowserCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.interactivebrowsercredential?view=azure-dotnet) method.

The affected method is used in the following articles: 
* [*Tutorial: Code a client app*](tutorial-code.md)
* [*How-to: Write app authentication code*](how-to-authenticate-client.md)
* [*How-to: Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs*](how-to-use-apis-sdks.md)

The issue includes an error response of "Azure.Identity.AuthenticationFailedException" when trying to authenticate in a browser window. The browser window may fail to start up completely, or appear to authenticate the user successfully, while the client application still fails with the error.

### Troubleshooting steps

To resolve, have your applications explicitly use Azure.Identity version **1.1.1**. With this version of the library, the browser should load and authenticate as expected.

>[!NOTE]
> It's not sufficient to add the library without specifying any version, as that will still default to the latest **1.2.0**. You'll need to specify version **1.1.1** explicitly.

### Possible causes

This is related to an open issue with the latest version of the Azure.Identity library (version **1.2.0**): [*Fail to authenticate when using InteractiveBrowserCredential*](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/13940).

You will see this issue if you use version **1.2.0** in your Azure Digital Twins application, or if you add the library to your project without specifying a version (as that also defaults to this latest version).
