#CustomerIntent: As an operator, I want to configure a SQL Server source stage so that I can read messages from an SQL Server database for processing.

# Configure a SQL Server source stage in Azure IoT Data Processor Preview

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

The source stage is the first and required stage in an Azure IoT Data Processor Preview pipeline. The source stage gets data into the data processing pipeline and prepares it for further processing. The SQL Server source stage lets you read data from a Microsoft SQL Server database at a user-defined interval.

In the source stage, you define:

- Connection details for SQL Server.
- The interval at which to query the SQL Server database. The stage waits for a result before it resets the interval timer.
- A partitioning configuration based on your specific data processing requirements.

## Prerequisites

- A deployed instance of Azure IoT Data Processor Preview that includes the optional Data Processor component.
- A SQL Server database with all necessary raw data available is operational and reachable.

## Prepare the SQL Server database

Before you can read from your SQL Server database, you need to grant access to the database from the pipeline. You can use `Username/Password`, `Managed identity`, or `Service principal` to authenticate the pipeline to the database. The advantage of using a managed identity is that you don't need to manage the lifecycle of the service principal or the password details. The managed identity is automatically managed by Azure and is tied to the lifecycle of the resource it's assigned to.

# [Service principal](#tab/serviceprincipal)

To create a service principal with a client secret:

[!INCLUDE [data-processor-create-service-principal](../includes/data-processor-create-service-principal.md)]

To grant access to the **Principal ID** in your SQL Server database, run the following command in the database:

```sql
CREATE USER processor FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER WITH OBJECT_ID=<principalId>;
```

> [!NOTE]
> To run the previous command, you must use the Entra ID listed as the **admin** in SQL Server.

For the source stage to connect to your SQL Server database, it needs access to a secret that contains the authentication details. To create a secret:

1. Use the following command to add a secret to your Azure Key Vault that contains the client secret you made a note of when you created the service principal:

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name <your-key-vault-name> --name AccessADXSecret --value <client-secret>
    ```

1. Add the secret reference to your Kubernetes cluster by following the steps in [Manage secrets for your Azure IoT Operations deployment](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-manage-secrets.md).

# [Managed identity](#tab/managedidentity)

To find the principal ID of the managed identity, run the following commands. Replace the placeholders with your cluster name and resource group:

```azurecli
CLUSTER_NAME=<Your connected cluster name>
RESOURCE_GROUP=<The resource group where your connected cluster is installed>
SUBSCRIPTION=<The subscription where your connected cluster is installed>
EXTENSION_NAME=processor

OBJECT_ID=$(az k8s-extension show --name $EXTENSION_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-type connectedClusters --query identity.principalId -o tsv --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION)
echo "Principal ID: " $OBJECT_ID
```

To grant access to the **Principal ID** in your SQL Server database, run the following command in the database:

```sql
CREATE USER processor FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER WITH OBJECT_ID=<principalId>;
```

> [!NOTE]
> To run the previous command, you must use the Entra ID listed as the **admin** in SQL Server.

## Configure the SQL Server source

To configure the SQL Server source:

- Provide details of the SQL Server database. This configuration includes the server name and a query to retrieve the data.
- Specify the authentication method. Currently limited to username/password-based or service principal-based authentication.

The following table describes the SQL Server source configuration parameters:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default | Example |
|----|---|---|---|---|---|
| Name | String | A customer-visible name for the source stage. | Required | NA | `erp-database` |
| Description | String | A customer-visible description of the source stage. | Optional | NA | `Enterprise database` |
| Server host | String | The URL to use to connect to the server.  | Required | NA | `https://contoso.com/some/url/path` |
| Server port | Integer | The port number to connect to on the server.  | Required | `1433` | `1433` |
| Authentication | Authentication type | The authentication method for connecting to the server. One of: `None`, `Username/Password`, `Managed identity`, or `Service principal`. | Optional | `NA` | `Username/Password` |
| Username/Password > Username | String | The username for the username/password authentication | Yes | NA | `myuser` |
| Username/Password > Secret | String | Reference to the password stored in Azure Key Vault. | Yes | Yes | `AKV_USERNAME_PASSWORD` |
| Service principal > Tenant ID | String | The Tenant ID of the service principal. | Yes | NA | `<Tenant ID>` |
| Service principal > Client ID | String | The Client ID of the service principal. | Yes | NA | `<Client ID>` |
| Service principal > Secret | String | Reference to the service principal client secret stored in Azure Key Vault. | Yes | NA | `AKV_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL` |
| Database | String | The name of the SQL Server database to query.  | Required | NA | `erp_db` |
| Data query | String | The query to run against the database. | Required | NA | `SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column_name = foo` |
| Query interval | [Duration](concept-configuration-patterns.md#duration) | String representation of the time to wait before the next API call. | Required | `10s`| `24h` |
| Data format | [Format](#select-data-format) | Data format of the incoming data | Required | NA | `{"type": "json"}` |
| Partitioning | [Partitioning](#configure-partitioning) | Partitioning configuration for the source stage. | Required | NA | See [partitioning](#configure-partitioning) |

To learn more about secrets, see [Manage secrets for your Azure IoT Operations Preview deployment](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-manage-secrets.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Requests timeout in 30 seconds if there's no response from the SQL server.

## Select data format

[!INCLUDE [data-processor-data-format](../includes/data-processor-data-format.md)]

## Configure partitioning

[!INCLUDE [data-processor-configure-partition](../includes/data-processor-configure-partition.md)]

| Field | Description | Required | Default | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Partition type | The type of partitioning to be used: Partition `ID` or Partition `Key` | Required | `ID` | `ID` |
| Partition expression | The [jq expression](../process-data/concept-jq-expression.md) to use on the incoming message to compute the partition `ID` or partition `Key` | Required | `0` | `.payload.header` |
| Number of partitions| The number of partitions in a Data Processor pipeline. | Required | `1` | `1` |

Data Processor adds metadata to the incoming message. See [Data Processor message structure overview](concept-message-structure.md) to understand how to correctly specify the partitioning expression that runs on the incoming message. By default, the partitioning expression is set to `0` with the **Partition type** as `ID` to send all the incoming data to a single partition.

For recommendations and to learn more, see [What is partitioning?](../process-data/concept-partitioning.md).
