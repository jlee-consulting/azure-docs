# Deploy Azure IoT Operations Preview extensions to a Kubernetes cluster

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

Deploy Azure IoT Operations Preview to a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure CLI. Once you have Azure IoT Operations deployed, then you can use the Azure IoT Orchestrator Preview service to manage and deploy other workloads to your cluster.

## Prerequisites

Cloud resources:

* An Azure subscription.

* Azure access permissions. At a minimum, have **Contributor** permissions in your Azure subscription. Depending on the deployment feature flag status you select, you might also need **Microsoft/Authorization/roleAssignments/write** permissions for the resource group that contains your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. You can make a custom role in Azure role-based access control or assign a built-in role that grants this permission. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles for General](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/general.md).

  If you *don't* have role assignment write permissions, you can still deploy Azure IoT Operations by disabling some features. This approach is discussed in more detail in the [Deploy extensions](#deploy-extensions) section of this article.

  * In the Azure CLI, use the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command to give permissions. For example, `az role assignment create --assignee sp_name --role "Role Based Access Control Administrator" --scope subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup`

  * In the Azure portal, you're prompted to restrict access using conditions when you assign privileged admin roles to a user or principal. For this scenario, select the **Allow user to assign all roles** condition in the **Add role assignment** page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/howto-deploy-iot-operations/add-role-assignment-conditions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows assigning users highly privileged role access in the Azure portal.":::

* An Azure Key Vault that has the **Permission model** set to **Vault access policy**. You can check this setting in the **Access configuration** section of an existing key vault. If you need to create a new key vault, use the [az keyvault create](/cli/azure/keyvault#az-keyvault-create) command:

  ```azurecli
  az keyvault create --enable-rbac-authorization false --name "<KEYVAULT_NAME>" --resource-group "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
  ```

Development resources:

* Azure CLI installed on your development machine. For more information, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). This scenario requires Azure CLI version 2.46.0 or higher. Use `az --version` to check your version and `az upgrade` to update if necessary.

* The Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI. Use the following command to add the extension or update it to the latest version:

  ```azurecli
  az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
  ```

A cluster host:

* An Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have one, follow the steps in [Prepare your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster](./howto-prepare-cluster.md?tabs=wsl-ubuntu).

  If you've already deployed Azure IoT Operations to your cluster, uninstall those resources before continuing. For more information, see [Update Azure IoT Operations](#update-azure-iot-operations).

  Azure IoT Operations should work on any CNCF-conformant kubernetes cluster. Currently, Microsoft only supports K3s on Ubuntu Linux and WSL, or AKS Edge Essentials on Windows. Using Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is the simplest way to get a Kubernetes cluster for testing.

  Use the Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI to verify that your cluster host is configured correctly for deployment by using the [verify-host](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-verify-host) command on the cluster host:

  ```azurecli
  az iot ops verify-host
  ```

## Deploy extensions

Use the Azure CLI to deploy Azure IoT Operations components to your Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

1. Sign in to Azure CLI interactively with a browser even if you already signed in before. If you don't sign in interactively, you might get an error that says *Your device is required to be managed to access your resource* when you continue to the next step to deploy Azure IoT Operations.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're using GitHub Codespaces in a browser, `az login` returns a localhost error in the browser window after logging in. To fix, either:
   >
   > * Open the codespace in VS Code desktop, and then run `az login` in the terminal. This opens a browser window where you can log in to Azure.
   > * Or, after you get the localhost error on the browser, copy the URL from the browser and use `curl <URL>` in a new terminal tab. You should see a JSON response with the message "You have logged into Microsoft Azure!".

1. Deploy Azure IoT Operations to your cluster. Use optional flags to customize the [az iot ops init](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-init) command to fit your scenario.

   By default, the `az iot ops init` command takes the following actions, some of which require that the principal signed in to the CLI has elevated permissions:

     * Set up a service principal and app registration to give your cluster access to the key vault.
     * Configure TLS certificates.
     * Configure a secrets store on your cluster that connects to the key vault.
     * Deploy the Azure IoT Operations resources.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az iot ops init --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --kv-id <KEYVAULT_SETTINGS_PROPERTIES_RESOURCE_ID>
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > By default, the [az iot ops init](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-init) command doesn't deploy the Data Processor component. To deploy Data Processor, add the `--include-dp` argument.

   If you don't have **Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignment/write** permissions in the resource group, add the `--disable-rsync-rules` feature flag. This flag disables the resource sync rules on the deployment.

   If you want to use an existing service principal and app registration instead of allowing `init` to create new ones, include the `--sp-app-id,` `--sp-object-id`, and `--sp-secret` parameters. For more information, see [Configure service principal and Key Vault manually](howto-manage-secrets.md#configure-service-principal-and-key-vault-manually).

1. After the deployment is complete, you can use [az iot ops check](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-check) to evaluate IoT Operations service deployment for health, configuration, and usability. The *check* command can help you find problems in your deployment and configuration.

   ```azurecli
   az iot ops check
   ```

   You can also check the configurations of topic maps, QoS, and message routes by adding the `--detail-level 2` parameter for a verbose view.

## View resources in your cluster

While the deployment is in progress, you can watch the resources being applied to your cluster. You can use kubectl commands to observe changes on the cluster or, since the cluster is Arc-enabled, you can use the Azure portal.

To view the pods on your cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n azure-iot-operations
```

It can take several minutes for the deployment to complete. Rerun the `get pods` command to refresh your view.

To view your cluster on the Azure portal, use the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group that contains your cluster.

1. From the **Overview** of the resource group, select the name of your cluster.

1. On your cluster, select **Extensions** from the menu.

   You can see that your cluster is running extensions of the type **microsoft.iotoperations.x**, which is the group name for all of the Azure IoT Operations components and the orchestration service.

   There's also an extension called **akvsecretsprovider**. This extension is the secrets provider that you configured and installed on your cluster with the `az iot ops init` command. You might delete and reinstall the Azure IoT Operations components during testing, but keep the secrets provider extension on your cluster.

> [!TIP]
> You can run `az iot ops check` to assess health and configurations of deployed AIO workloads. By default, MQ including cloud connectors are assessed and you can [specifiy the service](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-check-examples) with `--ops-service --svc`.

## Uninstall Azure IoT Operations

Use the [az iot ops delete](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-delete) command to delete or uninstall Azure IoT Operations from a cluster. The `delete` command evaluates the Azure IoT Operations related resources on the cluster and presents a tree view of the resources to be deleted. The cluster should be online prior to running.

The `delete` command removes:

* Azure IoT Operations extensions
* Azure IoT Operations resource sync rules
* Azure IoT Operations resources
* Associated custom location

```azurecli
az iot ops delete --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
```

## Update Azure IoT Operations

Currently, there's no support for updating an existing Azure IoT Operations deployment. Instead, uninstall and redeploy a new version of Azure IoT Operations.

1. Use the [az iot ops delete](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-delete) command to delete the Azure IoT Operations deployment on your cluster.

   ```azurecli
   az iot ops delete --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
   ```

1. Update the CLI extension to get the latest Azure IoT Operations version.

   ```azurecli
   az extension update --name azure-iot-ops
   ```

1. Follow the steps in this article to deploy the newest version of Azure IoT Operations to your cluster.

   >[!TIP]
   >Add the `--ensure-latest` flag to the `az iot ops init` command to check that the latest Azure IoT Operations CLI version is installed and raise an error if an upgrade is available.
