# Troubleshoot Azure IoT Operations Preview

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

This article contains troubleshooting tips for Azure IoT Operations Preview.

## General deployment troubleshooting

For general deployment and configuration troubleshooting, you can use the Azure CLI IoT Operations *check* and *support* commands.

[Azure CLI version 2.46.0 or higher](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) is required and the [Azure IoT Operations extension](/cli/azure/iot/ops) installed.

- Use [az iot ops check](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-check) to evaluate Azure IoT Operations service deployment for health, configuration, and usability. The *check* command can help you find problems in your deployment and configuration.

- Use [az iot ops support create-bundle](/cli/azure/iot/ops/support#az-iot-ops-support-create-bundle) to collect logs and traces to help you diagnose problems. The *support create-bundle* command creates a standard support bundle zip archive you can review or provide to Microsoft Support.

## Data Processor pipeline deployment troubleshooting

If your Data Processor pipeline deployment status is showing as **Failed**, use the following commands to find the pipeline error codes.

To list the Data Processor pipeline deployments, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pipelines -A
```

The output from the pervious command looks like the following example:

```text
NAMESPACE                NAME                           AGE
azure-iot-operations     passthrough-data-pipeline      2d20h
azure-iot-operations     reference-data-pipeline        2d20h
azure-iot-operations     contextualized-data-pipeline   2d20h
```

To view detailed information for a pipeline, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl describe pipelines passthrough-data-pipeline -n azure-iot-operations
```

The output from the previous command looks like the following example:

```text
...
Status:
  Provisioning Status:
    Error
      Code:  <ErrorCode>
      Message: <ErrorMessage>
    Status:        Failed
Events:            <none>
```

If you see the following message when you try to access the **Pipelines** tab in the Azure IoT Operations (preview) portal:

_Data Processor not found in the current deployment. Please re-deploy with the additional argument to include the Data Processor._

You need to deploy Azure IoT Operations with the optional Data Processor component included. To do this, you need to add the `--include-dp` argument when you run the [az iot ops init](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-init) command. You must use the `--include-dp` argument to include the Data Processor component when you first deploy Azure IoT Operations. You can't add this optional component to an existing deployment.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to delete the Azure IoT Operations deployment but plan on reinstalling it on your cluster, use the [az iot ops delete](/cli/azure/iot/ops?az-iot-ops-delete) command.

## Azure IoT Layered Network Management Preview troubleshooting

The troubleshooting guidance in this section is specific to Azure IoT Operations when using the Layered Network Management component. For more information, see [How does Azure IoT Operations Preview work in layered network?](../manage-layered-network/concept-iot-operations-in-layered-network.md).

### Can't install Layered Network Management on the parent level

If the Layered Network Management operator install fails or you can't apply the custom resource for a Layered Network Management instance:

1. Verify the regions are supported for public preview. Public preview supports eight regions. For more information, see [Quickstart: Deploy Azure IoT Operations Preview](../get-started/quickstart-deploy.md#connect-a-kubernetes-cluster-to-azure-arc).
1. If there are any other errors in installing Layered Network Management Arc extensions, follow the guidance included with the error. Try uninstalling and installing the extension.
1. Verify the Layered Network Management operator is in the *Running and Ready* state.
1. If applying the custom resource `kubectl apply -f cr.yaml` fails, the output of this command lists the reason for error. For example, CRD version mismatch or wrong entry in CRD.

### Can't Arc-enable the cluster through the parent level Layered Network Management

If you repeatedly remove and onboard a cluster with the same machine, you might get an error while Arc-enabling the cluster on nested layers. For example:

```output
Error: We found an issue with outbound network connectivity from the cluster to the endpoints required for onboarding.
Please ensure to meet the following network requirements 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster?tabs=azure-cli#meet-network-requirements'
If your cluster is behind an outbound proxy server, please ensure that you have passed proxy parameters during the onboarding of your cluster.
```

1. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
    ```

1. Reboot the host machine.

### Other types of Arc-enablement failures

1. Add the `--debug` parameter when running the `connectedk8s` command.
1. Capture and investigate a network packet trace. For more information, see [capture Layered Network Management packet trace](#capture-layered-network-management-packet-trace).

### Can't install Azure IoT Operations on the isolated cluster

You can't install Azure IoT Operations components on nested layers. For example, Layered Network Management on level 4 is running but can't install Azure IoT Operations on level 3.

1. Verify the nodes can access the Layered Network Management service running on parent level. For example, run `ping <IP-ADDRESS-L4-LNM>` from the node.
1. Verify the DNS queries are being resolved to the Layered Network Management service running on the parent level using the following commands:

    ```bash
    nslookup management.azure.com
    ```

    DNS should respond with the IP address of the Layered Network Management service.

1. If the domain is being resolved correctly, verify the domain is added to the allowlist. For more information, see [Check the allowlist of Layered Network Management](#check-the-allowlist-of-layered-network-management).
1. Capture and investigate a network packet trace. For more information, see [capture Layered Network Management packet trace](#capture-layered-network-management-packet-trace).

### A pod fails when installing Azure IoT Operations on an isolated cluster

When installing the Azure IoT Operations components to a cluster, the installation starts and proceeds. However, initialization of one or few of the components (pods) fails.

1. Identify the failed pod

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n azure-iot-operations
    ```

1. Get details about the pod:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod [POD NAME] -n azure-iot-operations
    ```

1. Check the container image related information. If the image download fails, check if the domain name of download path is on the allowlist. For example:

    ```output
    Warning  Failed  3m14s  kubelet  Failed to pull image "â€¦
    ```

### Check the allowlist of Layered Network Management

Layered Network Management blocks traffic if the destination domain isn't on the allowlist.

1. Run the following command to list the config maps.

    ```bash
    kubectl get cm -n azure-iot-operations
    ```

1. The output should look like the following example:

    ```output
    NAME                           DATA   AGE
    aio-lnm-level4-config          1      50s
    aio-lnm-level4-client-config   1      50s
    ```

1. The *xxx-client-config* contains the allowlist. Run:

    ```bash
    kubectl get cm aio-lnm-level4-client-config -o yaml
    ```

1. All the allowed domains are listed in the output.

### Capture Layered Network Management packet trace

In some cases, you might suspect that Layered Network Management instance at the parent level isn't forwarding network traffic to a particular endpoint. Connection to a required endpoint is causing an issue for the service running on your node. It's possible that the service you enabled is trying to connect to a new endpoint after an update. Or you're trying to install a new Arc extension or service that requires connection to endpoints that aren't on the default allowlist. Usually there would be information in the error message to notify the connection failure. However, if there's no clear information about the missing endpoint, you can capture the network traffic on the child node for detailed debugging.

#### Windows host

1. Install Wireshark network traffic analyzer on the host.
1. Run Wireshark and start capturing.
1. Reproduce the installation or connection failure.
1. Stop capturing.

#### Linux host

1. Run the following command to start capturing:

    ```bash
    sudo tcpdump -W 5 -C 10 -i any -w AIO-deploy -Z root
    ```

1. Reproduce the installation or connection failure.
1. Stop capturing.

#### Analyze the packet trace

Use Wireshark to open the trace file. Look for connection failures or unresponsive connections.

1. Filter the packets with the *ip.addr == [IP address]* parameter. Input the IP address of your custom DNS service address.
1. Review the DNS query and response, check if there's a domain name that isn't on the allowlist of Layered Network Management.
