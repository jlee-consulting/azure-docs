# Virtual machine certification - issues and solutions

While publishing your virtual machine (VM) images to Azure Marketplace, the Azure team validates the VM image to ensure its bootability, security, and Azure compatibility. If any of the high-quality tests fail, the publishing will fail with a message containing the error.

This article explains common error messages for VM images. It also discusses related solutions:

> [!NOTE]
> If you have questions or feedback for improvement, contact [Partner Center Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/v2/?stage=1).

## Approved base image

When you submit a request to republish your image with updates, the part-number verification test case may fail. In that instance, your image won't be approved.

This failure will occur when you used a base image that belongs to another publisher and you have updated the image. In this situation, you won't be allowed to publish your image.

To fix this issue, retrieve your latest image from Azure Marketplace and make changes to that image. See the following to view approved base images where you can search for your image:

- [Linux-Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json)
- [Windows-Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-create-vhd#select-an-approved-base)

## VM extension failure

To check whether your image supports VM Extension or not, follow these steps:

Enable VM Extensions:

1. Select the Linux VM.
2. Go to **Diagnostics settings**.
3. Enable Base matrices by updating the **Storage account**.
4. Select **Save**.

   ![Enable guest-level monitoring](./media/vm-certification-issues-solutions-1.png)

Check whether VM Extensions are properly activated:

5. Go to the **VM extensions** tab of the VM and verify the **Linux Diagnostics Extension**.
6. If the Status is **Provisioning Succeeded** then the Extensions test case has passed.
7. If the Status is **Provisioning Failed** then the Extensions test case has failed and you need to set the Hardened flag.

   ![Provisioning succeeded](./media/vm-certification-issues-solutions-2.png)

   If the VM extension fails, go to [Use Linux Diagnostic Extension to monitor metrics and logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/diagnostics-linux) to enable it. If you don't want the VM extension to be enabled, contact the support team and ask them to disable the extension.

## Virtual machine provisioning issue

Check that the provisioning process is rigorously followed for the VM before submitting your offer. To view the json format for provisioning the VM, go to [Azure Virtual Machine (VM) image certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-deploy-json-template).

Provisioning issues can include the following failure scenarios:

|S.NO|error|reason|solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Invalid virtual hard disk (VHD)|If the specified cookie value in the VHD footer isn't correct, then the VHD will be considered invalid.|Recreate the image and submit the request.|
|2|Invalid Blob Type|VM provisioning failed as the used block is a blob type instead of a page type.|Recreate the image and submit the request.|
|3|Provisioning timeout or not properly generalized|There's an issue with VM generalization.|Recreate the image with generalization and submit the request.|

> [!NOTE]
> Follow these links for documentation related to VM generalization:
> - [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-configure-vm#generalize-the-image)
> - [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource#generalize-the-windows-vm-using-sysprep)

## Software compliance for Windows

If your windows image request is rejected because of software compliance, then you may have created a Windows image with the SQL server installed, instead of taking the relevant SQL version base image from Azure Marketplace.

Don't create your own windows image with SQL server installed in it. Instead, use the approved SQL base images (Enterprise/Standard/web) from Azure Marketplace.

If you're trying to install Visual studio or any office licensed product, then contact the support team for prior approval.

For more information, visit [Create your Azure Virtual Machine technical assets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-create-vhd#select-an-approved-base) to select an approved base.

## Tool kit test case execution failed

The Microsoft Certification toolkit will help you to execute test cases verify that your VHD/Image is compatible with the Azure environment.

Download the [Microsoft Certification toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-partner-portal/virtual-machine/cpp-certify-vm).

## Linux test cases

The following are the Linux test cases that the toolkit will execute. Test validation is stated in the description.

|S.No|test cases|description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Bash History|Bash history files should be cleared before creating the VM image.|
|2|Linux Agent Version|Azure Linux Agent 2.2.41 and beyond should be installed.|
|3|Required Kernel Parameters|Verifies the following kernel parameters are set: <br>console=ttyS0<br>earlyprintk=ttyS0<br>rootdelay=300|
|4|Swap Partition on OS Disk|Verifies that swap partitions aren't created on the OS disk.|
|5|Root Partition on OS Disk|Create single root partition for the OS disk.|
|6|OpenSSL Version|The OpenSSL Version should be greater or equal to v0.9.8.|
|7|Python Version|Python version 2.6+ is highly recommended.|
|8|Client Alive Interval|Set ClientAliveInterval to 180. On the application need, it can be set between 30 to 235. If you're enabling the SSH for your end users, this value must be set as explained.|
|9|OS Architecture|Only 64-bit operating systems are supported.|
|10|Auto Update|Identifies whether Linux Agent Auto Update is enabled.|

### Common errors found while executing the previous test cases

Common errors found while executing the previous test cases.
 
|S.NO|test case|error|solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Linux Agent Version Test Case|The minimum Linux agent version is 2.241 or higher. This requirement has been mandatory since May 1, 2020|The image must be updated with the required version to [submit the request](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4049215/extensions-and-virtual-machine-agent-minimum-version-support).|
|2|Bash History Test Case|You'll see an error if the size of the bash history in your submitted image is more than 1 KB. The size is restricted to 1 KB to ensure that any potentially sensitive information isn't captured in your bash history file.|To resolve this problem, mount the VHD to any other working VM and make any changes (for example, delete the `.bash` history files) you want to reduce the size to less than or equal to 1 KB.|
|3|Required Kernel Parameter Test Case|You'll receive this error when the value for **console** isn't set to **ttyS0**. Check by executing the command:<br>`cat /proc/cmdline`|Set the value for **console** to **ttyS0** and resubmit the request.|
|4|ClientAlive Interval Test Case|If the toolkit result gives you a failed result for this test case, there is an inappropriate value for **ClientAliveInterval**.|Set the value for **ClientAliveInterval** to less than or equal to 235, then resubmit the request.|

### Windows test cases

The following are the Windows test cases that the toolkit will execute. Test validation is stated in the description.

|S.No|test cases|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|OS Architecture|Azure only supports 64 bit operating systems.|
|2|User account dependency|Application execution shouldn't be dependant on the administrator account.|

If you come across any failures with the above test cases, refer to the **Description** column in the previous table for the solution. If you require more information, contact support team. 

## Data disk size verification

If the size of any request submitted with the data disk is greater than 1023 GB, that request won't be approved. This rule applies to both Linux & Windows.

resubmit the request with a size less than or equal to 1023 GB.

## OS disk size validation

Refer to the following rules for limitations on OS disk size. When you submit any request, verify that the OS disk size is within the limitation for Linux or Windows.

|OS|recommended VHD size|
|---|---|
|Linux|30 GB to 1023 GB|
|Windows|30 GB to 250 GB|

As VMs allow access to the underlying operating system, ensure that the VHD size is sufficiently large for the VHD. Because disks aren’t expandable without downtime, use a disk size between 30 and 50 GB.

|VHD size|actual occupied size|solution|
|---|---|---|
|>500 TiB|n/a|contact the support team for an exception approval.|
|250-500 TiB|>200 GiB different from blob size|contact the support team for an exception approval.|

> [!NOTE]
> Larger disk sizes incur higher costs and will incur a delay during provisioning and replication steps. Because of this delay and cost, the support team may seek justification for the exception approval.

## WannaCry patch verification test for Windows

To prevent a potential attack related to WannaCry virus, ensure that all the windows image requests are updated with the latest patch.

To check the Windows Server patched version, refer to the following table for the OS detail and the minimum version it will support. 

The image file version can be verified from `C:\windows\system32\drivers\srv.sys` or `srv2.sys`.

> [!NOTE]
> WindowsServer2019 doesn't have any mandatory version requirements.

|OS|version|
|---|---|
|WindowsServer2008R2|6.1.7601.23689|
|WindowsServer2012|6.2.9200.22099|
|WindowsServer2012R2|6.3.9600.18604|
|WindowsServer2016|10.0.14393.953|
|WindowsServer2019|NA|

## SACK vulnerability patch verification

When you submit a Linux image, your request may be rejected because of kernel version issues.

Update the kernel with an approved version and resubmit the request. You can find the approved kernel version in the following table. The version number should be equal to or greater than the one listed below.

If your image in not installed with one of the following kernel versions, update your image with the correct patches. You can find more information from the following links. Request the necessary approval from the support team after the image is updated with these required patches:

- CVE-2019-11477 
- CVE-2019-11478 
- CVE-2019-11479

## Image size should be in multiples of megabytes

All VHDs on Azure must have a virtual size aligned to multiple of 1 MB. If your VHD doesn't adhere to the recommended virtual size, your request might get rejected.

follow guidelines, when you're converting from a raw disk to VHD and must ensure that the raw disk size is a multiple of 1 MB. For more information, see [Information for Non-endorsed Distributions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-generic)

## VM access denied

If you come across access denied issues while executing the test cases on VM, it may be because of insufficient privileges to execute the test cases.

Check whether proper access is enabled for the account on which the self-test cases are executing. if they are not, enable access to execute the test cases. If you don't want to enable access, you may share the self-test case results with the support team.

## Download failure
    
Refer to the following table for any issues when downloading the VM image using SAS URL.

|S.NO|error|reason|solution|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Blob Not Found|The VHD may either be deleted or moved from the specified location|| 
|2|Blob in Use|The VHD is use by another internal process|The VHD should be in a used state when downloading using SAS URL.|
|3|Invalid SAS URL|The associated SAS URL for that VHD is incorrect.|Get the correct SAS URL.|
|4|Invalid Signature|The associated SAS URL for that VHD is incorrect.|Get the correct SAS URL.|
|6|HTTP Conditional Header|Invalid SAS URL.|Get the correct SAS URL.|
|7|Invalid VHD Name|Check whether any special characters such as **%** or **“ “** exist in the VHD name|Rename the VHD file by removing special characters|

## First 1 MB partition

When submitting the VHD, ensure that the first 1 MB partition of the VHD is empty. Otherwise, your request will fail.

## Default credentials

Always ensure that default credentials aren't sent with the submitted VHD. Adding default credentials makes the VHD more vulnerable to security threats. Instead, create your own credentials when submitting the VHD.
  
## DataDisk mapped incorrectly

When a request is submitted with multiple data disks, but their order isn't in sequence, this is considered a mapping issue. For example, if there are three data disks, the numbering order must be **0, 1, 2**. Any other order will be treated as a mapping issue.

resubmit the request with proper sequencing of data disks.

## Incorrect OS mapping

When an image is created, it may be mapped or assigned to the wrong OS label. For example, when **Windows** is selected as a part of the OS name while creating the image, the OS disk should only be installed with Windows. The same applies to Linux.

## VM not generalized

If all images taken from Azure Marketplace are to be reused, then the operating system VHD must be generalized.

Linux:

The following process generalizes a Linux VM and redeploys it as a separate VM.

In the SSH window, enter the following command: `sudo waagent -deprovision+user`

Windows:

Windows images are generalized with `sysreptool`.

You can find more information on this tool at [Sysprep (System Preparation) Overview]( https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview)

## DataDisk error

Refer the following table for solutions to errors related to the data disk.

|Error|reason|solution|
|---|---|---|
|`DataDisk- InvalidUrl:`|This error may be because of an invalid number specified for LUN while submitting the offer.|Verify that the LUN number sequence for the data disk is in Partner center.|
|`DataDisk- NotFound:`|This error may be because of a data disk not being located at a specified SAS URL|Verify the data disk is located at SAS URL specified in the request.|

## Remote Access issue

If the RDP option isn't enabled for the Windows image, you will receive this error. 

Enable RDP access for Windows images before submitting.

## Next Steps

If you have questions or feedback for improvement, contact [Partner Center Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/v2/?stage=1).
