# How to deploy non-Java applications in Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to deploy your non-java application to Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier.

## Prerequisites

- An already provisioned Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier instance. For more information, see [Quickstart: Provision an Azure Spring Apps service instance using the Enterprise tier](quickstart-provision-service-instance-enterprise.md).
- One or more applications running in Azure Spring Apps. For more information on creating apps, see [How to Deploy Spring Boot applications from Azure CLI](./how-to-launch-from-source.md).
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), version 2.0.67 or higher.
- Your application source code.

## Deploy your application

To deploy from a source code folder your local machine, see [Non-Java application restrictions](#application-restriction).

To deploy the source code folder to an active deployment, use the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app deploy
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --service <your-Azure-Spring-Apps-name> \
    --name <your-app-name> \
    --source-path <path-to-source-code>
```

## Application restriction

Your application must conform to the following restrictions:

- Your application must listen on port 8080. The service checks the port on TCP for readiness and liveness.
- If your source code contains a package management folder, such as *node_modules*, ensure the folder contains all the dependencies. Otherwise, remove it and let Azure Spring Apps install it.
- To see whether your source code language is supported and the feature is provided, see the [Support Matrix](#support-matrix) section.

## Support matrix

The following table indicates the features supported for each language.
