# Quotas and service plans for Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java ✔️ C#

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

All Azure services set default limits and quotas for resources and features. Azure Spring Apps offers two pricing tiers: Basic and Standard. We will detail limits for both tiers in this article.

## Azure Spring Apps service tiers and limits

> [!TIP]
> Limits listed for Total app instances per service instance apply for apps and deployments in any state, including stopped state. Be sure to delete apps or deployments that aren't in use.

## Next steps

Some default limits can be increased. If your setup requires an increase, [create a support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).
