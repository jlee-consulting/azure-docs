# View Azure Spring Apps Enterprise Tier offering in Azure Marketplace

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to view the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise Tier with VMware Tanzu offering through Azure Marketplace and how to redirect to the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier creation page from Azure Marketplace.

Azure Spring Apps Enterprise Tier is optimized for the needs of enterprise Spring developers through advanced configurability, flexibility, portability, and enterprise-ready VMware Spring Runtime 24x7 support. Developers also benefit from commercial Tanzu components, such as VMware Tanzu® Build Service™, Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu®, and VMware Tanzu® Service Registry, and access to Spring experts.

You can obtain and pay for a license to Tanzu components through an [Azure Marketplace offering](https://aka.ms/ascmpoffer). Azure Spring Apps manages the license acquisition so you won't have to do it yourself.

## Prerequisites

To purchase in the Azure Marketplace, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- Your Azure subscription is registered to the `Microsoft.SaaS` resource provider. See how to [register a resource provider](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md#register-resource-provider).
- Your Azure subscription has an [associated payment method](/marketplace/azure-marketplace-overview#purchasing-requirements). Azure credits or free MSDN subscriptions aren't supported.
- Your Azure subscription belongs to a billing account in a [Marketplace supported geographic location](../marketplace/marketplace-geo-availability-currencies.md#supported-geographic-locations).
- Your organization allows [Azure Marketplace purchases](../cost-management-billing/manage/ea-azure-marketplace.md#enabling-azure-marketplace-purchases).
- Your organization allows acquiring any Azure Marketplace software application listed in [Purchase policy management](/marketplace/azure-purchasing-invoicing#purchase-policy-management).
