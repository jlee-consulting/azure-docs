# Create Azure Spring Apps instance with availability zone enabled

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

This article explains availability zones in Azure Spring Apps, and how to enable them.

In Microsoft Azure, [Availability Zones (AZ)](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more data centers that are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Availability zones protect your applications and data from data center failures.

When an Azure Spring Apps service instance is created with availability zone enabled, Azure Spring Apps will automatically distribute fundamental resources across logical sections of underlying Azure infrastructure. This distribution provides a higher level of availability to protect against a hardware failure or a planned maintenance event.

## How to create an instance in Azure Spring Apps with availability zone enabled

>[!NOTE]
> You can only enable availability zone when creating your instance. You can't enable or disable availability zone after creation of the service instance.

You can enable availability zone in Azure Spring Apps using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create a service in Azure Spring Apps with availability zone enabled using the Azure CLI, include the `--zone-redundant` parameter when you create your service in Azure Spring Apps.

```azurecli
az spring create \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --name <your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name> \
    --location <location> \
    --zone-redundant true
```

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To create a service in Azure Spring Apps with availability zone enabled using the Azure portal, enable the Zone Redundant option when creating the instance.
