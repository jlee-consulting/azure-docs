# Use Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard tier ✔️ Enterprise tier

This article shows you how to use Spring Cloud Gateway for VMware Tanzu® with Azure Spring Apps Enterprise Tier.

[Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Spring-Cloud-Gateway-for-Kubernetes/index.html) is one of the commercial VMware Tanzu components. It's based on the open-source Spring Cloud Gateway project. Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu handles cross-cutting concerns for API development teams, such as single sign-on (SSO), access control, rate-limiting, resiliency, security, and more. You can accelerate API delivery using modern cloud native patterns, and any programming language you choose for API development.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu also has the following features:

- Other commercial API route filters for transporting authorized JSON Web Token (JWT) claims to application services.
- Client certificate authorization.
- Rate-limiting approaches.
- Circuit breaker configuration.
- Support for accessing application services via HTTP Basic Authentication credentials.

To integrate with [API portal for VMware Tanzu®](./how-to-use-enterprise-api-portal.md), Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu automatically generates OpenAPI version 3 documentation after the route configuration gets changed.

## Prerequisites

- An already provisioned Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier service instance with Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu enabled. For more information, see [Quickstart: Provision an Azure Spring Apps service instance using the Enterprise tier](quickstart-provision-service-instance-enterprise.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > To use Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu, you must enable it when you provision your Azure Spring Apps service instance. You cannot enable it after provisioning at this time.

- [Azure CLI version 2.0.67 or later](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## How Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu works

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu has two components: Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu operator and Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu instance. The operator is responsible for the lifecycle of Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu instances and routing rules. It's transparent to the developer and Azure Spring Apps will manage it.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu instance routes traffic according to rules. It supports rich features, and you can customize it using the sections below. Both scale in/out and up/down are supported to meet dynamic traffic load.

Default resource usage:

| Component name                          | Instance count | vCPU per instance | Memory per instance |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu          | 2              | 1 core            | 2Gi                 |
| Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu operator | 2              | 1 core            | 2Gi                 |

## Configure Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu is configured using the following sections and steps.

### Configure Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu metadata

Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu metadata is used to automatically generate OpenAPI version 3 documentation so that the [API portal](./how-to-use-enterprise-api-portal.md) can gather information to show the route groups.

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| scope        | Yes       | A list of scopes to include in JWT identity tokens. This list should be based on the scopes allowed by your identity provider.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

To set up SSO with Azure AD, see [How to set up single sign-on with Azure AD for Spring Cloud Gateway and API Portal for Tanzu](./how-to-set-up-sso-with-azure-ad.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Only authorization servers supporting OpenID Connect Discovery protocol are supported. Also, be sure to configure the external authorization server to allow redirects back to the gateway. Refer to your authorization server's documentation and add `https://<gateway-external-url>/login/oauth2/code/sso` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.
>
> If you configure the wrong SSO property, such as the wrong password, you should remove the entire SSO property and re-add the correct configuration.
>
> After configuring SSO, remember to set `ssoEnabled=true` for the Spring Cloud Gateway routes.

### Requested resource

Customization of the resource usage for Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu instances is supported, including vCpu, memory, and instance count.

> [!NOTE]
> For high available consideration, single replica is not recommended.

## Configure routes

This section describes how to add, update, and manage API routes for apps that use Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu.

### Define route config

The route config definition includes the following parts:

- OpenAPI URI: The URI points to an OpenAPI specification. Both OpenAPI 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0 specs are supported. The specification can be shown in API portal to try out. Two types of URI are accepted. The first type of URI is a public endpoint like `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`. The second type of URI is a constructed URL `http://<app-name>/{relative-path-to-OpenAPI-spec}`, where `app-name` is the name of an application in Azure Spring Apps that includes the API definition.
- routes: A list of route rules about how the traffic goes to one app.

Use the following command to create a route config. The `--app-name` value should be the name of an app hosted in Azure Spring Apps that the requests will route to.

```azurecli
az spring gateway route-config create \
    --name <route-config-name> \
    --app-name <app-name> \
    --routes-file <routes-file.json>
```

Here's a sample of the JSON file that is passed to the `--routes-file` parameter in the create command:

```json
{
   "open_api": {
      "uri": "<OpenAPI-URI>"
   },
   "routes": [
      {
         "title": "<title-of-route>",
         "description": "<description-of-route>",
         "predicates": [
            "<predicate-of-route>",
         ],
         "ssoEnabled": true,
         "filters": [
            "<filter-of-route>",
         ],
         "tags": [
            "<tag-of-route>"
         ],
         "order": 0
      }
   ]
}
```

The following tables list the route definitions. All the properties are optional.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

- BasicAuth
- JWTKey

## Create an example application

Use the following steps to create an example application using Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu.

1. To create an app in Azure Spring Apps that the Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu would route traffic to, follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Apps using the Enterprise tier](quickstart-deploy-apps-enterprise.md). Select `customers-service` for this example.

1. Assign a public endpoint to the gateway to access it.

   Select the **Spring Cloud Gateway** section, then select **Overview** to view the running state and resources given to Spring Cloud Gateway and its operator.

   Select **Yes** next to *Assign endpoint* to assign a public endpoint. You'll get a URL in a few minutes. Save the URL to use later.

   :::image type="content" source="media/enterprise/getting-started-enterprise/gateway-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal Azure Spring Apps overview page with 'Assign endpoint' highlighted.":::

   You can also use CLI to do it, as shown in the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az spring gateway update --assign-endpoint
   ```

1. Use the following command to configure Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu properties:

   ```azurecli
   az spring gateway update \
       --api-description "<api-description>" \
       --api-title "<api-title>" \
       --api-version "v0.1" \
       --server-url "<endpoint-in-the-previous-step>" \
       --allowed-origins "*"
   ```

   You can also view those properties in the portal.

   :::image type="content" source="media/enterprise/how-to-use-enterprise-spring-cloud-gateway/gateway-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing Azure Spring Apps Spring Cloud Gateway page with Configuration pane showing.":::

1. Configure routing rules to apps.

   Create rules to access apps deployed in the above step through Spring Cloud Gateway for Tanzu.

   Save the following content to the *customers-service.json* file.

   ```json
   {
      "routes": [
         {
            "title": "Customers service",
            "description": "Route to customer service",
            "predicates": [
               "Path=/api/customers-service/owners",
               "Method=GET"
            ],
            "filters": [
               "StripPrefix=2",
            ],
            "tags": [
               "pet clinic"
            ]
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

   Use the following command to apply the rule to the app `customers-service`:
