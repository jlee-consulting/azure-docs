# Manage favorites

The **Favorites** list in the Azure portal lets you quickly go to the services you use most often. We've already added some common services to your **Favorites** list, but you may want to customize it by adding or removing items. You're the only one who sees the changes you make to **Favorites**.

You can view your **Favorites** list in the Azure portal menu, or from the **Favorites** section within **All services**.

## Add a favorite service

Items that are listed under **Favorites** are selected from **All services**. Within **All services**, you can hover over a service name to display information and resources related to the service. A filled star icon ![Filled star icon](./media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-graystar.png) next to the service name indicates that the item appears in the **Favorites** list. If the star icon isn't filled in for a service, select the star icon to add it to your **Favorites** list.

In this example, we'll add **Cost Management + Billing** to the **Favorites** list.

1. Select **All services** from the Azure portal menu.

1. Enter the word "cost" in the **Filter services** field near the top of the **All services** pane. Services that have "cost" in the title or that have "cost" as a keyword are shown.

1. Hover over the service name to display the **Cost Management + Billing** information card. Select the star icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the star icon to add a service to Favorites in the Azure portal.":::

1. **Cost Management + Billing** is now added as the last item in your **Favorites** list.

## Rearrange your favorite services

When you add a new service to your **Favorites** list, it appears as the last item in the list. To move it to a different position, select the new service, then drag and drop it to the desired location.

You can continue to drag and drop any service in your **Favorites** list to place them in the order you choose.

## Remove an item from Favorites

You can remove items directly from the **Favorites** list.

1. In the **Favorites** section of the portal menu, or within the **Favorites** section of **All services**, hover over the name of the service you want to remove.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites/azure-portal-favorites-remove.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to remove a service from Favorites in the Azure portal.":::

2. On the information card, select the star so that it changes from filled to unfilled.

The service is then removed from your **Favorites** list.
