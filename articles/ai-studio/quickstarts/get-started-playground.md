# Quickstart: Create a project and use the chat playground in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) quickstart, you create a project, deploy a chat model, and use it in the chat playground in Azure AI Studio.

The steps in this quickstart include:

1. Create an Azure AI Studio project.
1. Deploy an Azure OpenAI model.
1. Chat in the playground without your data.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- You need an Azure AI Studio hub or permissions to create one. Your user role must be **Azure AI Developer**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** on the hub. For more information, see [hubs](../concepts/ai-resources.md) and [Azure AI roles](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).
    - If your role is **Contributor** or **Owner**, you can [create a hub in this tutorial](#create-a-project-in-azure-ai-studio). 
    - If your role is **Azure AI Developer**, the hub must already be created. 

- Your subscription needs to be below your [quota limit](../how-to/quota.md) to [deploy a new model in this tutorial](#deploy-a-chat-model). Otherwise you already need to have a [deployed chat model](../how-to/deploy-models-openai.md).

## Create a project in Azure AI Studio

Your project is used to organize your work and save state. 

[!INCLUDE [Create project](../includes/create-projects.md)]

## Deploy a chat model

[!INCLUDE [Deploy chat model](../includes/deploy-chat-model.md)]

## Chat in the playground without your data

In the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) playground you can observe how your model responds with and without your data. In this quickstart, you test your model without your data. 

[!INCLUDE [Chat without your data](../includes/chat-without-data.md)]

Next, you can add your data to the model to help it answer questions about your products. Try the [Deploy an enterprise chat web app](../tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app.md) and [Build and deploy a question and answer copilot with prompt flow in Azure AI Studio](../tutorials/deploy-copilot-ai-studio.md) tutorials to learn more.
