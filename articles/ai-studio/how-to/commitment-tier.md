# Commitment tier pricing for Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

Azure AI Studio offers commitment tier pricing, each offering a discounted rate compared to the pay-as-you-go pricing model. With commitment tier pricing, you can commit to using the Azure AI Studio hubs and features for a fixed fee, enabling you to have a predictable total cost based on the needs of your workload.

## Purchase a commitment plan by updating your Azure resource

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure subscription.
1. Select the existing Azure resource you want to purchase a commitment plan for.
1. From the collapsible left menu, select **Resource Management** > **Commitment tier pricing**.
1. Select **Change** to view the available commitments for hosted API and container usage. Choose a commitment plan for one or more of the following offerings:
    * **Web**: web-based APIs, where you send data to Azure for processing.
    * **Connected container**: Docker containers that enable you to [deploy Azure AI services on premises](../../ai-services/cognitive-services-container-support.md), and maintain an internet connection for billing and metering.

1. In the window that appears, select both a **Tier** and **Auto-renewal** option.

    * **Commitment tier** - The commitment tier for the feature. The commitment tier is enabled immediately when you select **Purchase** and you're charged the commitment amount on a pro-rated basis.

    * **Auto-renewal** - Choose how you want to renew, change, or cancel the current commitment plan starting with the next billing cycle. If you decide to autorenew, the **Auto-renewal date** is the date (in your local timezone) when you'll be charged for the next billing cycle. This date coincides with the start of the calendar month.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Once you select **Purchase** you will be charged for the tier you select. Once purchased, the commitment plan is non-refundable.
    >
    > Commitment plans are charged monthly, except the first month upon purchase which is pro-rated (cost and quota) based on the number of days remaining in that month. For the subsequent months, the charge is incurred on the first day of the month.

## Overage pricing

If you use the resource above the quota provided, you're charged for the extra usage as per the overage amount mentioned in the commitment tier.

## Purchase a different commitment plan

The commitment plans have a calendar month commitment period. You can purchase a commitment plan at any time from the default pay-as-you-go pricing model. When you purchase a plan, you're charged a pro-rated price for the remaining month. During the commitment period, you can't change the commitment plan for the current month. However, you can choose a different commitment plan for the next calendar month. The billing for the next month would happen on the first day of the next month.

## End a commitment plan

If you decide that you don't want to continue purchasing a commitment plan, you can set your resource's autorenewal to **Do not auto-renew**. Your commitment plan expires on the displayed commitment end date. After this date, you won't be charged for the commitment plan. You're able to continue using the Azure resource to make API calls, charged at pay-as-you-go pricing. You have until midnight (UTC) on the last day of each month to end a commitment plan, and not be charged for the following month.

## Purchase a commitment tier pricing plan for disconnected containers

Commitment plans for disconnected containers have a calendar year commitment period. These plans are different the than web and connected container commitment plans. When you purchase a commitment plan, you're charged the full price immediately. During the commitment period you can't change your commitment plan. However, you can purchase more units at a pro-rated price for the remaining days in the year. You have until midnight (UTC) on the last day of your commitment, to end a commitment plan.

You can choose a different commitment plan in the **Commitment Tier pricing** settings of your resource.

## Overage pricing for disconnected containers

To use a disconnected container beyond the quota initially purchased with your disconnected container commitment plan, you can purchase more quota by updating your commitment plan at any time. 

To purchase more quota, go to your resource in Azure portal and adjust the "unit count" of your disconnected container commitment plan using the slider. This adds more monthly quota and you're charged a pro-rated price based on the remaining days left in the current billing cycle.
