For a deeper understanding of how the evaluation metrics are derived, you can access a comprehensive explanation by selecting the 'Understand more about metrics' option. This detailed resource provides valuable insights into the calculation and interpretation of the metrics used in the evaluation process.

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/understand-metrics-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the evaluation metrics details." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/understand-metrics-details.png":::

You can choose a specific run, which will take you to the run detail page. Here, you can access comprehensive information, including evaluation details such as test dataset, task type, prompt, temperature, and more. Furthermore, you can view the metrics associated with each data sample. The metrics scores charts provide a visual representation of how scores are distributed for each metric throughout your dataset.

Within the metrics detail table, you can conduct a comprehensive examination of each individual data sample. Here, you can scrutinize the generated output and its corresponding evaluation metric score. This level of detail enables you to make data-driven decisions and take specific actions to improve your model's performance.

Some potential action items based on the evaluation metrics could include:

- Pattern Recognition: By filtering for numerical values and metrics, you can drill down to samples with lower scores. Investigate these samples to identify recurring patterns or issues in your model's responses. For instance, you might notice that low scores often occur when the model generates content on a certain topic.
- Model Refinement: Use the insights from lower-scoring samples to improve the system prompt instruction or fine-tune your model. If you observe consistent issues with, for example, coherence or relevance, you can also adjust the model's training data or parameters accordingly.
- Column Customization: The column editor empowers you to create a customized view of the table, focusing on the metrics and data that are most relevant to your evaluation goals. This can streamline your analysis and help you spot trends more effectively.
- Keyword Search: The search box allows you to look for specific words or phrases in the generated output. This can be useful for pinpointing issues or patterns related to particular topics or keywords and addressing them specifically.

The metrics detail table offers a wealth of data that can guide your model improvement efforts, from recognizing patterns to customizing your view for efficient analysis and refining your model based on identified issues.

We break down the aggregate views or your metrics by**Performance and quality** and **Risk and safety metrics**. You can view the distribution of scores across the evaluated dataset and see aggregate scores for each metric.  

- For performance and quality metrics, we aggregate by calculating an average across all the scores for each metric.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of performance and quality metrics dashboard tab." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details-page.png":::
- For risk and safety metrics, we aggregate based on a threshold to calculate a defect rate across all scores for each metric. Defect rate is defined as the percentage of instances in your test dataset that surpass a threshold on the severity scale over the whole dataset size. 
    :::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details-safety-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of risk and safety metrics dashboard tab." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details-safety-metrics.png":::

Here are some examples of the metrics results for the question answering scenario:

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/metrics-details-qa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of metrics results for the question answering scenario." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/metrics-details-qa.png":::

And here are some examples of the metrics results for the conversation scenario:

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/metrics-details-rag.png" alt-text="Screenshot of metrics results for the conversation scenario." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/metrics-details-rag.png":::

For multi-turn conversation scenario, you can select “View evaluation results per turn” to check the evaluation metrics for each turn in a conversation.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/multi-turn-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing view evaluation results per turn link in input message." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/multi-turn-chat.png":::

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/metric-per-turn.png" alt-text="Screenshot of evaluation results per turn." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/metric-per-turn.png":::

For risk and safety metrics, the evaluation provides a severity score and reasoning for each score. Here are some examples of risk and safety metrics results for the question answering scenario:

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/risk-safety-metric-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of risk and safety metrics results for question answering scenario." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/risk-safety-metric-example.png":::

Evaluation results may have different meanings for different audiences. For example, safety evaluations may generate a label for “Low” severity of violent content that may not align to a human reviewer’s definition of how severe that specific violent content might be. We provide a **human feedback** column with thumbs up and thumbs down when reviewing your evaluation results to surface which instances were approved or flagged as incorrect by a human reviewer.

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/risk-safety-metric-human-feedback.png" alt-text="Screenshot of risk and safety metrics results with human feedback." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/risk-safety-metric-human-feedback.png":::

When understanding each content risk metric, you can easily view each metric definition and severity scale by selecting on the metric name above the chart to see a detailed explanation in a pop-up.

If there's something wrong with the run, you can also debug your evaluation run with the log and trace.

Here are some examples of the logs that you can use to debug your evaluation run:

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of logs that you can use to debug your evaluation run." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-log.png":::

And here's an example of the tracing and debugging view:

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-trace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the trace that you can use to debug your evaluation run." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-trace.png":::

If you're evaluating a prompt flow, you can select the  **View in flow** button to navigate to the evaluated flow page to make update to your flow. For example, adding additional meta prompt instruction, or change some parameters and re-evaluate.  

## Compare the evaluation results

To facilitate a comprehensive comparison between two or more runs, you have the option to select the desired runs and initiate the process by selecting either the **Compare** button or, for a general detailed dashboard view, the **Switch to dashboard view** button. This feature empowers you to analyze and contrast the performance and outcomes of multiple runs, allowing for more informed decision-making and targeted improvements.

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-list-compare.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the option to compare evaluations." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-list-compare.png":::

In the dashboard view, you have access to two valuable components: the metric distribution comparison chart and the comparison table. These tools enable you to perform a side-by-side analysis of the selected evaluation runs, allowing you to compare various aspects of each data sample with ease and precision.

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/dashboard-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metric evaluations page with the option to select manual evaluations." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/dashboard-view.png":::

Within the comparison table, you have the capability to establish a baseline for your comparison by hovering over the specific run you wish to use as the reference point and set as baseline. Moreover, by activating the 'Show delta' toggle, you can readily visualize the differences between the baseline run and the other runs for numerical values. Additionally, with the 'Show only difference' toggle enabled, the table displays only the rows that differ among the selected runs, aiding in the identification of distinct variations.

Using these comparison features, you can make an informed decision to select the best version:

- Baseline Comparison: By setting a baseline run, you can identify a reference point against which to compare the other runs. This allows you to see how each run deviates from your chosen standard.
- Numerical Value Assessment: Enabling the 'Show delta' option helps you understand the extent of the differences between the baseline and other runs. This is useful for evaluating how various runs perform in terms of specific evaluation metrics.
- Difference Isolation: The 'Show only difference' feature streamlines your analysis by highlighting only the areas where there are discrepancies between runs. This can be instrumental in pinpointing where improvements or adjustments are needed.

By using these comparison tools effectively, you can identify which version of your model or system performs the best in relation to your defined criteria and metrics, ultimately assisting you in selecting the most optimal option for your application.

## Measuring jailbreak vulnerability

Evaluating jailbreak is a comparative measurement, not an AI-assisted metric. Run evaluations on two different, red-teamed datasets: a baseline adversarial test dataset versus the same adversarial test dataset with jailbreak injections in the first turn. You can use the adversarial data simulator to generate the dataset with or without jailbreak injections.

To understand if your application is vulnerable to jailbreak, you can specify which is the baseline and then turn on “Jailbreak defect rates” toggle in the comparison table. Jailbreak defect rate is defined as the percentage of instances in your test dataset where a jailbreak injection generated a higher severity score for *any* content risk metric with respect to a baseline over the whole dataset size. You can select multiple evaluations in your compare dashboard to view the difference in defect rates.

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-compare-jailbreak.png" alt-text="Screenshot of side by side evaluation results with jailbreak defect toggled on." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-compare-jailbreak.png":::

> [!TIP]
> Jailbreak defect rate is comparatively calculated only for datasets of the same size and only when all runs include content risk and safety metrics.

## Understand the built-in evaluation metrics

Understanding the built-in metrics is vital for assessing the performance and effectiveness of your AI application. By gaining insights into these key measurement tools, you're better equipped to interpret the results, make informed decisions, and fine-tune your application to achieve optimal outcomes. To learn more about the significance of each metric, how it's being calculated, its role in evaluating different aspects of your model, and how to interpret the results to make data-driven improvements, refer to [Evaluation and Monitoring Metrics](../concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in.md).
