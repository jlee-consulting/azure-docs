# How to deploy Cohere Command models with Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use Azure AI Studio to deploy the Cohere Command models as serverless APIs with pay-as-you-go token-based billing.

Cohere offers two Command models in [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com). These models are available as serverless APIs with pay-as-you-go token-based billing. You can browse the Cohere family of models in the [model catalog](model-catalog.md) by filtering on the Cohere collection.

## Cohere Command models 

In this section, you learn about the two Cohere Command models that are available in the model catalog:

* Cohere Command R 
* Cohere Command R+

You can browse the Cohere family of models in the [Model Catalog](model-catalog-overview.md) by filtering on the Cohere collection.

- **Model Architecture:** Both Command R and Command R+ are auto-regressive language models that use an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining, the models use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training to align model behavior to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

- **Languages covered:** The models are optimized to perform well in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic.

    Pre-training data additionally included the following 13 languages: Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, Persian.

- **Context length:** Command R and Command R+ support a context length of 128K.

- **Input:** Models input text only.

- **Output:** Models generate text only.

## Deploy as a serverless API

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

The previously mentioned Cohere models can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go billing and are offered by Cohere through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Cohere can change or update the terms of use and pricing of these models.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [Azure AI Studio hub](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md). The serverless API model deployment offering for Cohere Command is only available with hubs created in these regions:

     * East US
     * East US 2
     * North Central US
     * South Central US
     * West US
     * West US 3
     * Sweden Central
    
    For a list of  regions that are available for each of the models supporting serverless API endpoint deployments, see [Region availability for models in serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).

- An [AI Studio project](../how-to/create-projects.md) in Azure AI Studio.
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __Azure AI Developer role__ on the resource group. For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).


### Create a new deployment

The following steps demonstrate the deployment of Cohere Command R, but you can use the same steps to deploy Cohere Command R+ by replacing the model name.

To create a deployment:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Select **Model catalog** from the left sidebar.
1. Search for *Cohere*.
1. Select **Cohere-command-r** to open the Model Details page.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-directly-from-catalog.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to access the model details page by going through the model catalog." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-directly-from-catalog.png"::: 

1. Select **Deploy** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.
1. Alternatively, you can initiate a deployment by starting from your project in AI Studio. 

    1. From the left sidebar of your project, select **Components** > **Deployments**.
    1. Select **+ Create deployment**.
    1. Search for and select **Cohere-command-r**. to open the Model Details page.
 
       :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-start-from-project.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to access the model details page by going through the Deployments page in your project." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-start-from-project.png"::: 

    1. Select **Confirm** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-pay-as-you-go.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to deploy a model as a serverless API." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deploy-pay-as-you-go.png":::

1. Select the project in which you want to deploy your model. To deploy the model your project must be in the *EastUS2* or *Sweden Central* region.
1. In the deployment wizard, select the link to **Azure Marketplace Terms** to learn more about the terms of use.
1. Select the **Pricing and terms** tab to learn about pricing for the selected model.
1. Select the **Subscribe and Deploy** button. If this is your first time deploying the model in the project, you have to subscribe your project for the particular offering. This step requires that your account has the **Azure AI Developer role** permissions on the resource group, as listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure Marketplace offering of the model, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Currently, you can have only one deployment for each model within a project.
1. Once you subscribe the project for the particular Azure Marketplace offering, subsequent deployments of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. If this scenario applies to you, there's a **Continue to deploy** option to select.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-existing-subscription.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a project that is already subscribed to the offering." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-existing-subscription.png":::

1. Give the deployment a name. This name becomes part of the deployment API URL. This URL must be unique in each Azure region.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deployment-name.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to indicate the name of the deployment you want to create." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/cohere-command/command-r-deployment-name.png":::

1. Select **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is ready and you're redirected to the Deployments page.
1. Select **Open in playground** to start interacting with the model.
1. Return to the Deployments page, select the deployment, and note the endpoint's **Target** URL and the Secret **Key**. For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-cohere-models-deployed-as-a-service) section.
1. You can always find the endpoint's details, URL, and access keys by navigating to your **Project overview** page. Then, from the left sidebar of your project, select **Components** > **Deployments**.

To learn about billing for the Cohere models deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go token-based billing, see [Cost and quota considerations for models deployed as a serverless API](#cost-and-quota-considerations-for-models-deployed-as-a-serverless-api).

### Consume the Cohere models as a service

These models can be consumed using the chat API.

1. From your **Project overview** page, go to the left sidebar and select **Components** > **Deployments**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Copy the **Target** URL and the **Key** value.

2. Cohere exposes two routes for inference with the Command R and Command R+ models. The [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) on the route `/chat/completions` and the native [Cohere API](#cohere-chat-api).

For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-cohere-models-deployed-as-a-service) section.

## Reference for Cohere models deployed as a service

Cohere Command R and Command R+ models accept both the [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) on the route `/chat/completions` and the native [Cohere Chat API](#cohere-chat-api) on `/v1/chat`. 

### Azure AI Model Inference API

The [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) schema can be found in the [reference for Chat Completions](../reference/reference-model-inference-chat-completions.md) article and an [OpenAPI specification can be obtained from the endpoint itself](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md?tabs=rest#getting-started).

### Cohere Chat API

The following contains details about Cohere Chat API.

#### Request

```
    POST /v1/chat HTTP/1.1
    Host: <DEPLOYMENT_URI>
    Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
    Content-type: application/json
```

#### v1/chat request schema

Cohere Command R and Command R+ accept the following parameters for a `v1/chat` response inference call:

|Key       |Type   |Default   |Description   |
|---|---|---|---|
|`message`   |`string`   |Required   |Text input for the model to respond to.   |
|`chat_history`   |`array of messages`   |`None`   |A list of previous messages between the user and the model, meant to give the model conversational context for responding to the user's message.    |
|`documents`   |`array`   |`None `  |A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is a string-string dictionary. Keys and values from each document are serialized to a string and passed to the model. The resulting generation includes citations that reference some of these documents. Some suggested keys are "text", "author", and "date". For better generation quality, it's recommended to keep the total word count of the strings in the dictionary to under 300 words. An `_excludes` field (array of strings) can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields still show up in the citation object. The "_excludes" field aren't passed to the model. See [Document Mode](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) guide from Cohere docs.    |
|`search_queries_only`   |`boolean`  |`false`   |When `true`, the response only contains a list of generated search queries, but no search takes place, and no reply from the model to the user's `message` is generated.|
|`stream`   |`boolean`   |`false`   |When `true`, the response is a JSON stream of events. The final event contains the complete response, and has an `event_type` of `"stream-end"`. Streaming is beneficial for user interfaces that render the contents of the response piece by piece, as it gets generated.|
|`max_tokens`   |`integer`   |None   |The maximum number of tokens the model generates as part of the response. Note: Setting a low value might result in incomplete generations. If not specified, generates tokens until end of sequence.|
|`temperature`   |`float`   |`0.3`   |Use a lower value to decrease randomness in the response. Randomness can be further maximized by increasing the value of the `p` parameter. Min value is 0, and max is 2.   |
|`p`   |`float`   |`0.75`   |Use a lower value to ignore less probable options. Set to 0 or 1.0 to disable. If both p and k are enabled, p acts after k. min value of 0.01, max value of 0.99.|
|`k`   |`float`   |`0`   |Specify the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token. If both p and k are enabled, p acts after k. Min value is 0, max value is 500.|
|`prompt_truncation`   |`enum string`   |`OFF`   |Accepts `AUTO_PRESERVE_ORDER`, `AUTO`, `OFF`. Dictates how the prompt is constructed. With `prompt_truncation` set to `AUTO_PRESERVE_ORDER`, some elements from `chat_history` and `documents` are dropped to construct a prompt that fits within the model's context length limit. During this process, the order of the documents and chat history are preserved. With `prompt_truncation` set to "OFF", no elements are dropped.|
|`stop_sequences`  |`array of strings`  |`None`  |The generated text is cut at the end of the earliest occurrence of a stop sequence. The sequence is included the text.  |   
|`frequency_penalty`   |`float`   |`0`  |Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. The higher the value, the stronger a penalty is applied to previously present tokens, proportional to how many times they have already appeared in the prompt or prior generation. Min value of 0.0, max value of 1.0.|
|`presence_penalty`   |`float`   |`0`   |Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. Similar to `frequency_penalty`, except that this penalty is applied equally to all tokens that have already appeared, regardless of their exact frequencies. Min value of 0.0, max value of 1.0.|
|`seed`   |`integer`   |`None`   |If specified, the backend makes a best effort to sample tokens deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. However, determinism can't be guaranteed.|
|`return_prompt`   |`boolean `  |`false `  |Returns the full prompt that was sent to the model when `true`.   |
|`tools`   |`array of objects`   |`None`   |_Field is subject to changes._ A list of available tools (functions) that the model might suggest invoking before producing a text response. When `tools` is passed (without `tool_results`), the `text` field in the response is `""` and the `tool_calls` field in the response is populated with a list of tool calls that need to be made. If no calls need to be made, the `tool_calls` array is empty.|
|`tool_results`   |`array of objects`   |`None`   |_Field is subject to changes._ A list of results from invoking tools recommended by the model in the previous chat turn. Results are used to produce a text response and is referenced in citations. When using `tool_results`, `tools` must be passed as well. Each tool_result contains information about how it was invoked, and a list of outputs in the form of dictionaries. Cohere's unique fine-grained citation logic requires the output to be a list. In case the output is just one item, for example, `{"status": 200}`, still wrap it inside a list.   |

The `chat_history` object requires the following fields:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`role`   |`enum string`   |Takes `USER`, `SYSTEM`, or `CHATBOT`.   |
|`message`   |`string`   |Text contents of the message.   |

The `documents` object has the following optional fields:

|Key       |Type   |Default| Description   |
|---|---|---|---|
|`id`   |`string`   |`None` |Can be supplied to identify the document in the citations. This field isn't passed to the model.   |
|`_excludes`   |`array of strings`   |`None`| Can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields still show up in the citation object. The `_excludes` field isn't passed to the model.   |

#### v1/chat response schema

Response fields are fully documented on [Cohere's Chat API reference](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat). The response object always contains: 

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`response_id`   |`string`   |Unique identifier for chat completion.   |
|`generation_id`   |`string`   |Unique identifier for chat completion, used with Feedback endpoint on Cohere's platform.   |
|`text`   |`string`   |Model's response to chat message input.    |
|`finish_reason`   |`enum string`   |Why the generation was completed. Can be any of the following values: `COMPLETE`, `ERROR`, `ERROR_TOXIC`, `ERROR_LIMIT`, `USER_CANCEL` or `MAX_TOKENS`   |
|`token_count`   |`integer`   |Count of tokens used.   |
|`meta`   |`string`   |API usage data, including current version and billable tokens.   |

<br/>

#### Documents
If `documents` are specified in the request, there are two other fields in the response:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`documents `  |`array of objects`   |Lists the documents that were cited in the response.   |
|`citations`   |`array of objects`   |Specifies which part of the answer was found in a given document.    |

`citations` is an array of objects with the following required fields:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`start`   |`integer`   |The index of text that the citation starts at, counting from zero. For example, a generation of `Hello, world!` with a citation on `world` would have a start value of `7`. This is because the citation starts at `w`, which is the seventh character.   |
|`end`   |`integer`   |The index of text that the citation ends after, counting from zero. For example, a generation of `Hello, world!` with a citation on `world` would have an end value of `11`. This is because the citation ends after `d`, which is the eleventh character.   |
|`text`   |`string`   |The text of the citation. For example, a generation of `Hello, world!` with a citation of `world` would have a text value of `world`.   |
|`document_ids`   |`array of strings`   |Identifiers of documents cited by this section of the generated reply.   |

#### Tools
If `tools` are specified and invoked by the model, there's another field in the response:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`tool_calls `  |`array of objects`   |Contains the tool calls generated by the model. Use it to invoke your tools.   |

`tool_calls` is an array of objects with the following fields:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`name`  |`string`   |Name of the tool to call.   |
|`parameters`   |`object`   |The name and value of the parameters to use when invoking a tool. |

#### Search_queries_only
If `search_queries_only=TRUE` is specified in the request, there are two other fields in the response:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`is_search_required`  |`boolean`   |Instructs the model to generate a search query.   |
|`search_queries`   |`array of objects`   |Object that contains a list of search queries. |

`search_queries` is an array of objects with the following fields:

|Key       |Type   |Description   |
|---|---|---|
|`text`  |`string`   |The text of the search query.   |
|`generation_id`   |`string`   |Unique identifier for the generated search query. Useful for submitting feedback. |

#### Examples

##### Chat - Completions
The following example is a sample request call to get chat completions from the Cohere Command model. Use when generating a chat completion.

Request:

```json
    {
        "chat_history": [
            {"role":"USER", "message": "What is an interesting new role in AI if I don't have an ML background"},
            {"role":"CHATBOT", "message": "You could explore being a prompt engineer!"}
        ],
        "message": "What are some skills I should have"
    }
```

Response:

```json
    {
        "response_id": "09613f65-c603-41e6-94b3-a7484571ac30",
        "text": "Writing skills are very important for prompt engineering. Some other key skills are:\n- Creativity\n- Awareness of biases\n- Knowledge of how NLP models work\n- Debugging skills\n\nYou can also have some fun with it and try to create some interesting, innovative prompts to train an AI model that can then be used to create various applications.",
        "generation_id": "6d31a57f-4d94-4b05-874d-36d0d78c9549",
        "finish_reason": "COMPLETE",
        "token_count": {
            "prompt_tokens": 99,
            "response_tokens": 70,
            "total_tokens": 169,
            "billed_tokens": 151
        },
        "meta": {
            "api_version": {
                "version": "1"
            },
            "billed_units": {
                "input_tokens": 81,
                "output_tokens": 70
            }
        }
    }
```

##### Chat - Grounded generation and RAG capabilities

Command R and Command R+ are trained for RAG via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. We introduce that prompt template via the `documents` parameter. The document snippets should be chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk. Document snippets consist of key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings. The values can be text or semi-structured.

Request:

```json
    {
    "message": "Where do the tallest penguins live?",
    "documents": [
        {
        "title": "Tall penguins",
        "snippet": "Emperor penguins are the tallest."
        },
        {
        "title": "Penguin habitats",
        "snippet": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica."
        }
    ]
    }
```

Response:

                "title": "Penguin habitats"
            }
        ]
    }
```

##### Chat - Tool Use

If invoking tools or generating a response based on tool results, use the following parameters. 

Request:

```json
    {
        "message":"I'd like 4 apples and a fish please",
        "tools":[
            {
                "name":"personal_shopper",
                "description":"Returns items and requested volumes to purchase",
                "parameter_definitions":{
                    "item":{
                        "description":"the item requested to be purchased, in all caps eg. Bananas should be BANANAS",
                        "type": "str",
                        "required": true
                    },
                    "quantity":{
                        "description": "how many of the items should be purchased",
                        "type": "int",
                        "required": true
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        
    "tool_results": [
        {
        "call": {
            "name": "personal_shopper",
            "parameters": {
                "item": "Apples",
                "quantity": 4

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for models deployed as a serverless API

Cohere models deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing are offered by Cohere through the Azure Marketplace and integrated with Azure AI Studio for use. You can find the Azure Marketplace pricing when deploying the model.

Each time a project subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference; however, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently.

For more information on how to track costs, see [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace).

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits aren't sufficient for your scenarios. 

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing are protected by [Azure AI Content Safety](../../ai-services/content-safety/overview.md). With Azure AI content safety, both the prompt and completion pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Learn more about [content filtering here](../concepts/content-filtering.md).
