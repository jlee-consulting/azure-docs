# How to deploy Mistral models with Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-studio/includes/feature-preview.md)]

In this article, you learn how to use Azure AI Studio to deploy the Mistral family of models as serverless APIs with pay-as-you-go token-based billing.
Mistral AI offers two categories of models in the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com). These models are available in the [model catalog](model-catalog-overview.md):

* __Premium models__: Mistral Large (2402), Mistral Large (2407), and Mistral Small. 
* __Open models__: Mistral Nemo, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v01, Mixtral-8x7B-v01, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v01, and Mistral-7B-v01. 

All the premium models and Mistral Nemo (an open model) can be deployed as serverless APIs with pay-as-you-go token-based billing. The other open models can be deployed to managed computes in your own Azure subscription.

You can browse the Mistral family of models in the model catalog by filtering on the Mistral collection.

## Mistral family of models

# [Mistral Large](#tab/mistral-large)

Mistral Large is Mistral AI's most advanced Large Language Model (LLM). It can be used on any language-based task, thanks to its state-of-the-art reasoning and knowledge capabilities. There are two variants available for the Mistral Large model version:

- Mistral Large (2402)

## Deploy Mistral family of models as a serverless API

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing. This kind of deployment provides a way to consume models as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance that organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

**Mistral Large (2402)**, **Mistral Large (2407)**, **Mistral Small**, and **Mistral Nemo** can be deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing and are offered by Mistral AI through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Mistral AI can change or update the terms of use and pricing of these models.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [AI Studio hub](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md). The serverless API model deployment offering for eligible models in the Mistral family is only available with hubs created in these regions:

    - East US
    - East US 2
    - North Central US
    - South Central US
    - West US
    - West US 3
    - Sweden Central

    For a list of  regions that are available for each of the models supporting serverless API endpoint deployments, see [Region availability for models in serverless API endpoints](deploy-models-serverless-availability.md).

- An [Azure AI Studio project](../how-to/create-projects.md).
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __Azure AI Developer role__ on the resource group. For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).

### Create a new deployment

The following steps demonstrate the deployment of Mistral Large (2402), but you can use the same steps to deploy Mistral Nemo or any of the premium Mistral models by replacing the model name.

To create a deployment:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Select **Model catalog** from the left sidebar.
1. Search for and select the Mistral Large (2402) model to open its Details page.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-directly-from-catalog.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to access the model details page by going through the model catalog." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-directly-from-catalog.png"::: 

1. Select **Deploy** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.
1. Alternatively, you can initiate a deployment by starting from your project in AI Studio. 

    1. From the left sidebar of your project, select **Components** > **Deployments**.
    1. Select **+ Create deployment**.
    1. Search for and select the Mistral Large (2402) model to open the Model's Details page.

       :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-starting-from-project.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to access the model details page by going through the Deployments page in your project." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-starting-from-project.png"::: 

    1. Select **Confirm** to open a serverless API deployment window for the model.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-pay-as-you-go.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to deploy a model as a serverless API." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deploy-pay-as-you-go.png":::

1. Select the project in which you want to deploy your model. To use the serverless API model deployment offering, your project must belong to one of the regions listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. In the deployment wizard, select the link to **Azure Marketplace Terms** to learn more about the terms of use.
1. Select the **Pricing and terms** tab to learn about pricing for the selected model.
1. Select the **Subscribe and Deploy** button. If this is your first time deploying the model in the project, you have to subscribe your project for the particular offering. This step requires that your account has the **Azure AI Developer role** permissions on the resource group, as listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure Marketplace offering of the model, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Currently, you can have only one deployment for each model within a project.
1. Once you subscribe the project for the particular Azure Marketplace offering, subsequent deployments of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. If this scenario applies to you, there's a **Continue to deploy** option to select.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-existing-subscription.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a project that is already subscribed to the offering." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-existing-subscription.png":::

1. Give the deployment a name. This name becomes part of the deployment API URL. This URL must be unique in each Azure region.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deployment-name.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to indicate the name of the deployment you want to create." lightbox="../media/deploy-monitor/mistral/mistral-large-deployment-name.png":::

1. Select **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is ready and you're redirected to the Deployments page.
1. Select **Open in playground** to start interacting with the model.
1. Return to the Deployments page, select the deployment, and note the endpoint's **Target** URL and the Secret **Key**. For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-mistral-family-of-models-deployed-as-a-service) section.
1. You can always find the endpoint's details, URL, and access keys by navigating to your **Project overview** page. Then, from the left sidebar of your project, select **Components** > **Deployments**.

To learn about billing for the Mistral AI model deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go token-based billing, see [Cost and quota considerations for Mistral family of models deployed as a service](#cost-and-quota-considerations-for-mistral-family-of-models-deployed-as-a-service).

### Consume the Mistral family of models as a service

You can consume Mistral models by using the chat API.

1. From your **Project overview** page, go to the left sidebar and select **Components** > **Deployments**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Copy the **Target** URL and the **Key** value.

1. Make an API request using to either the [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) on the route `/chat/completions` and the native [Mistral Chat API](#mistral-chat-api) on `/v1/chat/completions`.

For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-mistral-family-of-models-deployed-as-a-service) section.

## Reference for Mistral family of models deployed as a service

Mistral models accept both the [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) on the route `/chat/completions` and the native [Mistral Chat API](#mistral-chat-api) on `/v1/chat/completions`. 

### Azure AI Model Inference API

The [Azure AI Model Inference API](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md) schema can be found in the [reference for Chat Completions](../reference/reference-model-inference-chat-completions.md) article and an [OpenAPI specification can be obtained from the endpoint itself](../reference/reference-model-inference-api.md?tabs=rest#getting-started).

### Mistral Chat API

Use the method `POST` to send the request to the `/v1/chat/completions` route:

__Request__

```rest
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: <DEPLOYMENT_URI>
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-type: application/json
```

#### Request schema

Payload is a JSON formatted string containing the following parameters:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `messages`    | `string`  | No default. This value must be specified.  | The message or history of messages to use to prompt the model.  |
| `stream`      | `boolean` | `False` | Streaming allows the generated tokens to be sent as data-only server-sent events whenever they become available.  |
| `max_tokens`  | `integer` | `8192`    | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. |
| `top_p`       | `float`   | `1`     | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering `top_p` or `temperature`, but not both.  |
| `temperature` | `float`   | `1`     | The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values mean the model samples more broadly the distribution of tokens. Zero means greedy sampling. We recommend altering this parameter or `top_p`, but not both.  |
| `ignore_eos`          | `boolean` | `False`  | Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating tokens after the EOS token is generated. |
| `safe_prompt` | `boolean` | `False`  | Whether to inject a safety prompt before all conversations. |

The `messages` object has the following fields:

| Key       | Type      | Value |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `content` | `string` | The contents of the message. Content is required for all messages. |
| `role`    | `string` | The role of the message's author. One of `system`, `user`, or `assistant`. |


#### Request example

__Body__

```json
{
    "messages":
    [
        { 
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to Italian."
        },
        {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Translate the following sentence from English to Italian: I love programming."
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 512,
}
```

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for Mistral family of models deployed as a service

Mistral models deployed as a serverless API are offered by Mistral AI through the Azure Marketplace and integrated with Azure AI Studio for use. You can find the Azure Marketplace pricing when deploying the model.

Each time a project subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference; however, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently.

For more information on how to track costs, see [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace).

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits aren't sufficient for your scenarios. 

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a serverless API with pay-as-you-go billing are protected by [Azure AI Content Safety](../../ai-services/content-safety/overview.md). With Azure AI content safety, both the prompt and completion pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Learn more about [content filtering here](../concepts/content-filtering.md).
