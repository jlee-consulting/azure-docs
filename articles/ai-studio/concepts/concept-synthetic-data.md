# Synthetic data generation in Azure AI Studio

In Azure AI Studio, you can leverage synthetic data generation to efficiently produce predictions for your datasets.

## Synthetic data generation

Synthetic data generation involves creating artificial data that mimics the statistical properties of real-world data. This data is generated using algorithms and machine learning techniques, and it can be used in various ways, such as computer simulations or by modeling real-world events.

In machine learning, synthetic data is particularly valuable for several reasons:

**Data Augmentation:** It helps in expanding the size of training datasets, which is crucial for training robust machine learning models. This is especially useful when real-world data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

**Testing and Validation:** It allows for extensive testing and validation of machine learning models under various scenarios without the need for real-world data.

You can use the sample notebook available at this [link](https://aka.ms/meta-llama-3.1-datagen) to see how to generate Synthetic data.
