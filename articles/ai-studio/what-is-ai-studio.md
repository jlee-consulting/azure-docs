### Model catalog

The model catalog is a collection of models that you can use in your projects. You can filter the models by collection, inference task (such as summarization and chat completion), license, and more.

:::image type="content" source="media/explore/home-model-catalog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the model catalog on the AI Studio home page." lightbox= "media/explore/home-model-catalog.png":::

### Model benchmarks

Assess model performance with evaluated metrics for accuracy, coherence, fluency, and similarity. Compare benchmarks across models and datasets available in the industry to assess which one meets your business scenario.

The model benchmarks tool helps you compare the performance of different models on a specific task. You can select a task, such as question answering or text generation, and see how different models perform on that task. You can also filter by specific models or model collections to see how they compare to each other.

### Prompt catalog

Prompt engineering is an important aspect of working with generative AI models as it allows users to have greater control, customization, and influence over the outputs. By skillfully designing prompts, users can harness the capabilities of generative AI models to generate desired content, address specific requirements, and cater to various application domains.   

The prompt catalog is a collection of prompts for common use cases such as generating text or images. You can filter the prompts by modality (such as chat, completions, image, and video), by industry (such as retail and education), and by task (such as summarization and chat completion).

:::image type="content" source="media/explore/home-prompt-catalog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the prompt catalog on the AI Studio home page." lightbox= "media/explore/home-prompt-catalog.png":::

Choose a sample prompt to see how it works or as a starting point for your project. Then customize it for your scenario and evaluate how it performs before integrating into your app.
