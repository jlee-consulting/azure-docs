# Quickstart: Propagate resources from an Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Fleet) hub cluster to member clusters

In this quickstart, you learn how to propagate resources from an Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Fleet) hub cluster to member clusters.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [free trial note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

* Read the [resource propagation conceptual overview](./concepts-resource-propagation.md) to understand the concepts and terminology used in this quickstart.
* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* You need a Fleet resource with a hub cluster and member clusters. If you don't have one, see [Create an Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager resource and join member clusters using Azure CLI](quickstart-create-fleet-and-members.md).
* Member clusters must be labeled appropriately in the hub cluster to match the desired selection criteria. Example labels include region, environment, team, availability zones, node availability, or anything else desired.
* You need access to the Kubernetes API of the hub cluster. If you don't have access, see [Access the Kubernetes API of the Fleet resource with Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](./quickstart-access-fleet-kubernetes-api.md).

## Use the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API to propagate resources to member clusters

The `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object is used to propagate resources from a hub cluster to member clusters. The `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object specifies the resources to propagate and the placement policy to use when selecting member clusters. The `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object is created in the hub cluster and is used to propagate resources to member clusters. This example demonstrates how to propagate a namespace to member clusters using the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object with a `PickAll` placement policy.

For more information, see [Kubernetes resource propagation from hub cluster to member clusters (Preview)](./concepts-resource-propagation.md) and the [upstream Fleet documentation](https://github.com/Azure/fleet/blob/main/docs/concepts/ClusterResourcePlacement/README.md).

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Create a namespace to place onto the member clusters using the `kubectl create namespace` command. The following example creates a namespace named `my-namespace`:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace my-namespace
    ```

2. Create a `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object in the hub cluster to propagate the namespace to the member clusters and deploy it using the `kubectl apply -f` command. The following example `ClusterResourcePlacement` creates an object named `crp` and uses the `my-namespace` namespace with a `PickAll` placement policy to propagate the namespace to all member clusters:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
    metadata:
      name: crp
    spec:
      resourceSelectors:
        - group: ""
          kind: Namespace
          version: v1          
          name: my-namespace
      policy:
        placementType: PickAll
    EOF
    ```

3. Check the progress of the resource propagation using the `kubectl get clusterresourceplacement` command. The following example checks the status of the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object named `crp`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get clusterresourceplacement crp
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME   GEN   SCHEDULED   SCHEDULEDGEN   APPLIED   APPLIEDGEN   AGE
    crp    2     True        2              True      2            10s
    ```

4. View the details of the `crp` object using the `kubectl describe crp` command. The following example describes the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object named `crp`:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe clusterresourceplacement crp
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    Name:         crp
    Namespace:    
    Labels:       <none>
    Annotations:  <none>

## Clean up resources

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

If you no longer wish to use the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object, you can delete it using the `kubectl delete` command. The following example deletes the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object named `crp`:

```bash
kubectl delete clusterresourceplacement crp
```

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

If you no longer wish to use your cluster resource placement, you can delete it from the Azure portal:

1. On the Azure portal overview page for your Fleet resource, in the **Fleet Resources** section, select **Resource placements**.

1. Select the cluster resource placement objects you want to delete, then select **Delete**.

1. In the **Delete** tab, verify the correct objects are chosen. Once you're ready, select **Confirm delete** and **Delete**.
