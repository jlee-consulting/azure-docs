# Configure OpenVPN for Point-to-Site VPN gateways

This article helps you set up **OpenVPNÂ® Protocol** on Azure VPN Gateway. You can use either the portal, or the PowerShell instructions.

## Prerequisites

* The article assumes that you already have a working point-to-site environment. If you don't, create one using one of the following methods. When creating your gateway, note that the **Basic** SKU does not support the OpenVPN tunnel type.

  * [Portal - Create point-to-site](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md)

  * [PowerShell - Create point-to-site](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps.md)

* If you already have a VPN gateway, verify that it does not use the **Basic** SKU. The Basic SKU is not supported for OpenVPN. For more information about SKUs, see [VPN Gateway configuration settings](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings.md). To resize a Basic SKU, see [Resize a legacy gateway](vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md#resource-manager). 

## Portal

1. In the portal, navigate to your **Virtual network gateway -> Point-to-site configuration**.
1. For **Tunnel type**, select **OpenVPN (SSL)** from the dropdown.

## PowerShell

1. Enable OpenVPN on your gateway using the following example, adjusting the values as necessary.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $gw = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName TestRG1 -name VNet1GW
   Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gw -VpnClientProtocol OpenVPN
   ```
1. Continue with **Next steps**.
