# Configure OpenVPN client for P2S certificate authentication connections - Windows

If your point-to-site (P2S) VPN gateway is configured to use OpenVPN and certificate authentication, you can connect to your virtual network using the OpenVPN Client. This article walks you through the steps to configure the **OpenVPN client** and connect to your virtual network.

## Before you begin

Before beginning client configuration steps, verify that you're on the correct VPN client configuration article. The following table shows the configuration articles available for VPN Gateway point-to-site VPN clients. Steps differ, depending on the authentication type, tunnel type, and the client OS.

### Prerequisites

This article assumes that you've already performed the following prerequisites:

* You created and configured your VPN gateway for point-to-site certificate authentication and the OpenVPN tunnel type. See [Configure server settings for P2S VPN Gateway connections - certificate authentication](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) for steps.
* You generated and downloaded the VPN client configuration files. See [Generate VPN client profile configuration files](vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md#profile-files) for steps.
* You can either generate client certificates, or acquire the appropriate client certificates necessary for authentication.

### Connection requirements

To connect to Azure using the OpenVPN client using certificate authentication, each connecting client computer requires the following items:

* The Open VPN Client software must be installed and configured on each client computer.
* The client computer must have a client certificate that's installed locally.

### Workflow

The workflow for this article is:

1. Generate and install client certificates if you haven't already done so.
1. View the VPN client profile configuration files contained in the VPN client profile configuration package that you generated.
1. Configure the OpenVPN client.
1. Connect to Azure.

## Generate and install client certificates

For certificate authentication, a client certificate must be installed on each client computer. The client certificate you want to use must be exported with the private key, and must contain all certificates in the certification path. Additionally, for some configurations, you'll also need to install root certificate information.

In many cases, you can install the client certificate directly on the client computer by double-clicking. However, for certain OpenVPN client configurations, you might need to extract information from the client certificate in order to complete the configuration.

* For information about working with certificates, see [Point-to site: Generate certificates](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md).
* To view an installed client certificate, open **Manage User Certificates**. The client certificate is installed in **Current User\Personal\Certificates**.

### Install the client certificate

Each computer needs a client certificate in order to authenticate. If the client certificate isn't already installed on the local computer, you can install it using the following steps:

1. Locate the client certificate. For more information about client certificates, see [Install client certificates](point-to-site-how-to-vpn-client-install-azure-cert.md).
1. Install the client certificate. Typically, you can do this by double-clicking the certificate file and providing a password (if required).

## View configuration files

The VPN client profile configuration package contains specific folders. The files within the folders contain the settings needed to configure the VPN client profile on the client computer. The files and the settings they contain are specific to the VPN gateway and the type of authentication and tunnel your VPN gateway is configured to use.

Locate and unzip the VPN client profile configuration package you generated. For Certificate authentication and OpenVPN, you should see an OpenVPN folder. If you don't see the folder, verify the following items:

* Verify that your VPN gateway is configured to use the OpenVPN tunnel type.
* If you're using Microsoft Entra authentication, you might not have an OpenVPN folder. See the [Microsoft Entra ID](point-to-site-entra-vpn-client-windows.md) configuration article instead.
